Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The LIHAN Bluetooth FM Transmitter is a Bluetooth module for the 12V power outlet in your car that comes in a small package. If you have an older model car without Bluetooth, an FM transmitter can bring you into the modern age—but not all transmitters are created equal. Let’s take a closer look at the design, usability, audio quality, and features to see how well this little transmitter performs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4600114&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.epubor.com/images/drm-removal-feature2.png"                      border="0"                >Any DRM Removal for Mac： Remove DRM from Adobe, Kindle, Sony eReader, Kobo, etc, read your ebooks anywhere.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mSg2vet114ak7qOuKwbfQVm4tOU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/05LW1999388-2-fec4e7b0197b432aa940131587d54294.jpg"                      alt="LIHAN LHFM1039 Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Benjamin Zeman</p><h2 id="Design-Simple-and-average"><a href="#Design-Simple-and-average" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simple and average"></a><strong>Design: Simple and average</strong></h2><p> We tested this transmitter in a 2018 Toyota RAV4, which has two cigarette lighter inputs under the dash. Having a small form factor mean that the Lihan bluetooth FM transmitter fit well in our vehicle. It measures 5.12 x 1.81 x 2.76 inches and 1.76 ounces, with a face that’s a little larger than we expected; we’ve seen smaller<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-fm-transmitters-for-car-1999388" >transmitters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , like the Aphaca BT69.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/aphaca-car-fm-transmitter-review-4771342" >Aphaca BT69 Wireless Car Bluetooth FM Transmitter Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The Lihan transmitter has a larger button used for handsfree calling in the lower center, with a small<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >LCD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> display just above it. To the left and right of the large button are two smaller next&#x2F;last buttons. All the buttons feel good when pressed and are easy to get to. On the other hand, the display is really hard to see because it isn’t very bright and has really poor viewing angles.</p><p> Overall we found the design of the transmitter to be very average and unexceptional.</p><p> Above the display there are two USB charging ports rated at 5V&#x2F;3.1A and 5V&#x2F;1.0A. The 3.1A USB port is for charging only and the 1.0A USB port also takes USB flash drives with supported audio formats but charges extremely slow. We also found because our 12V power outlet is in the dash, when<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> cables are plugged in they hang down over the display and buttons, making them difficult to see and get to.</p><p> On the top of the transmitter is a TF card port for MicroSD cards. Being on the top of the device and not the side meant we needed to remove it from the 12V power outlet to insert or remove a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s also the only port or button that isn’t on the face of the transmitter.</p><p> Overall we found the design of the transmitter to be very average and unexceptional. Nothing really stood out as good or bad. It’s not the best we’ve tested but it’s functional. We’ve seen worse, especially cramming too much on the front, causing a device to feel crowded like the Criar US-CP24.</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be"><a href="#Setup-Process-Easy-as-it-should-be" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Easy as it should be"></a><strong>Setup Process: Easy as it should be</strong></h2><p> This transmitter is really easy to set up, partially because of its dearth of special features. It’s almost plug and play, all you need to do is connect your bluetooth or plug in your MicroSD card or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-usb-flash-drives-4141193" >USB flash drive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . After plugging it into our car’s 12V power outlet the display lights up and the device is ready to pair.</p><p> We looked for HY82 in our Bluetooth connection settings and had our phone connected in no time. This Lihan transmitter uses Bluetooth version 4.0 and can connect with older versions as well. The transmitter also paired back up with our phone quickly after turning the car off and then on again.</p><p> After pairing our phone, hands free calling was easy. If a call comes in you can press the big button with a phone icon on it to answer. Don’t want to talk to that person? Hold down the same button for a few seconds. Done with a call and want to hang up? You got it, press the big button. You can even call back the last number that called you or the last number you called by quickly pressing the button twice.</p><p> Using audio files on a USB flash drive or MicroSD card is also easy. As long as they are in a supported format, you can insert a USB flash drive or MicroSD card up to 32GB and use the next&#x2F;last buttons to go to the next song or go back to the last song. This was one of those welcome instances where setup was a breeze, everything made sense, and it all just worked.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4699091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/1_jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh Plus -  Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

Generally with transmitters of this nature most static&#x2F;white noise comes from ground loops or wireless interference. We noticed both prominently with this model.</p><p>Every other transmitter we’ve tested outperforms the Lihan.</p><p> When there is silence during a phone call you can hear buzzing, bleeps, and other interesting noises. That’s a thing some people can deal with or don’t even notice, but it drives us crazy. When trying to talk on the phone, we found it distracting to the point that we didn’t want to use call features at all.</p><p> Streaming music through Bluetooth from a USB stick or MicroSD card sounded good as long as the volume was high enough to overpower the noise level. This transmitter does use Bluetooth version 4.0 which is pretty recent.</p><h2 id="Price-Too-pricey-for-the-problems"><a href="#Price-Too-pricey-for-the-problems" class="headerlink" title="Price: Too pricey for the problems"></a><strong>Price: Too pricey for the problems</strong></h2><p> The Lihan Bluetooth Car FM Transmitter averages between $17 and $20, placing it in the same price range as similar products. The Lihan does little to distinguish itself or stand out from similarly priced competitors. Even the packaging is simple and unappealing, with no indication of what’s inside except some small text on the back.</p><p> Lihan’s transmitter is average and generic at best. The amount of noise we got from our unit was just too much for us. It fails to stand up against less noisy transmitters, like the Nulaxy KM18 and Aphaca BT69. We don’t find the Lihan to be worth it, especially when you can find better options in the same price range.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Lihan-LHFM1039-vs-Criacr-US-CP24"><a href="#Lihan-LHFM1039-vs-Criacr-US-CP24" class="headerlink" title="Lihan LHFM1039 vs. Criacr US-CP24"></a><strong>Lihan LHFM1039 vs. Criacr US-CP24</strong></h2><p> The Criacr US-CP24 is another compact Bluetooth FM transmitter that is around the same size as the Lihan and has a similar user interface layout. The Criacr was another rather noisy unit but played some lossless audio formats like WAV and FLAC in addition to MP3 and WMA. The Criacr averages in the same price range and wasn’t as noisy as the Lihan (in fact, Lihan’s transmitter had the most noise issues of any transmitter we tested).</p><p> The Criacr US-CP24 definitely has its shortcomings and in that review we suggested the Aphaca BT69 instead, though the Aphaca is a little more expensive. Given the choice between the Lihan LHFM1039 and the Criacr US-CP24, the Criacr is a clear winner. We didn’t like the Criacr’s user interface design, but while it was noisy it never approached the noise levels of the Lihan. When a device’s main purpose is audio, the product with better sound is usually going to win.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/criacr-bluetooth-fm-transmitter-cp24-review-4771399" >Criacr Bluetooth FM Transmitter CP24 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Mediocre design meets poor sound.</strong></p><p> The Lihan Bluetooth Car FM transmitter isn’t going to win any design awards, but its user interface layout looks okay. Where the transmitter completely fails is inferior ground loop and interference noise mitigation.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BScreen%2BRecorder%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/f026b149-fc7c-fd54-5f3e-1460bbb19b6b.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a

But you may not know that AI is also being experimented with in the mental health realm.</p><p> Through this, researchers may be able to find new ways of supporting mental health patients and developing better forms of treatment. At the time of writing, AI is still in its infancy in terms of mental health applications, but this technology has a lot of potential in the mental healthcare industry.</p><p> So, how, exactly, might AI prove useful here, and in what ways may it pose a risk?</p><h3 id="Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI"><a href="#Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI" class="headerlink" title="Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI"></a>Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI</h3><p> Finding a therapist can take a long time, and can even be an inaccessible option for some due to its high cost. So, when someone needs advice and support immediately, who can they turn to?</p><p> There are hotlines for those seeking support, but talking to a real person about your problems can be daunting. So, using artificial intelligence, an individual may be able to access advice remotely without having to talk to a real person. This can alleviate the social anxiety associated with discussing personal issues, while also ensuring that the person struggling receives some form of support.</p><p> While regular chatbots can be used in such a scenario, an AI-powered chatbot will likely have the ability to communicate in a more personal way, further understand a person’s issue, and provide possible solutions or avenues. We’ve already seen how the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/" >ChatGPT chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can interact with users, so there’s likely some potential here for patient support.</p><p> Of course, some may see<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-using-ai-free-therapist-psychiatrist/" >using AI to provide mental health advice as risky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

While a human professional can do this well, the number of individuals requiring mental health support makes it difficult for human personnel to keep up with the demand.</p><p> This is where AI might be able to help. Using this technology, a patient could give inputs on how they’re feeling and what they’ve been doing, and an AI system could then assess and evaluate the information provided to determine whether there is any cause for concern. The AI system could then alert the relevant parties so that action can be taken. This may lower the occurrences of mental health negligence, as a far greater number of people could be assessed regularly without the need for a human professional.</p><p> But there are risks to consider here, and the AI system in use would have to be very thoroughly trained on how to spot possible red flags. Still, simply using this as an initial assessment could prove highly beneficial, both to doctors and patients.</p><h3 id="Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI"><a href="#Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI" class="headerlink" title="Developing New Support Techniques With AI"></a>Developing New Support Techniques With AI</h3><p> There’s no denying that researchers are still working to further understand our brains and why they give way to mental illnesses. Not only is the origin of mental illness still being researched, but techniques on how to better treat patients are also being developed.</p><p> For example, an AI system may be able to take a batch of data about patient symptoms, triggers, or backgrounds, and then suggest new ways to help them make progress. This could be a medication suggestion, a kind of therapy, or similar.</p><p> On top of this, AI has been proven to detect the presence of mental illnesses with a relatively high rate of accuracy. In a<a class="link"   href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt9gx593b0/qt9gx593b0%5FnoSplash%5Fd814b6b41c76cb874050695d2bf30ced.pdf" >2019 psychiatry report by IBM and the University of California <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it was stated that, when testing AI in mental illness detection, accuracy ranged from 62 to 92 percent (depending on the AI system and training data used). While the lower ends of this range aren’t too impressive, continued development may allow AI systems to reach a consistently high accuracy rate when detecting mental illnesses.</p><p> Though this all seems very promising, there are also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-ai-dangerous-5-immediate-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/" >dangers associated with using AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the mental health field and other ways that AI can worsen mental health in general.</p><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?</h2><p> While AI has significant potential to improve mental healthcare, there are also risks and dangers in the adoption of this fast-evolving technology.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://uperfect.sjv.io/c/5597632/1246754/15155" target="_top" id="1246754"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15155-1246754"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1246754/15155"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Increased-Reliance-on-AI"><a href="#Increased-Reliance-on-AI" class="headerlink" title="Increased Reliance on AI"></a>Increased Reliance on AI</h3><p> Over the past few decades, the rise of smart technology has led many people to rely on phones, PCs, tablets, and other devices to simplify and enhance their lives. Whether they’re chatting on social media, streaming movies, browsing for new clothes, or simply getting some work done, technology usually stands as the backbone. Many people are even<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/smartphone-addiction-how-overcome-negative-habit/" >addicted to their smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or computers, which can have a huge impact on their lives.</p><p> So, when AI becomes prominent across various industries, it could have a detrimental effect on mental health. For instance, an individual may opt to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-teachers-embrace-ai/" >use AI for their education <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , work, entertainment, and other elements of their social life. This, in turn, may lead to something of an AI addiction. There are already plenty of people addicted to social media, online shopping, and online gaming today, which can often give way to feelings of anxiety and very real social and financial problems.</p><h3 id="Lack-of-Human-Contact"><a href="#Lack-of-Human-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Human Contact"></a>Lack of Human Contact</h3><p> Humans are, by nature, social beings. So, it can often be hugely beneficial to discuss your feelings with somebody else, instead of dealing with them alone.</p><p> But if AI becomes increasingly used in the mental health industry, accessing face-to-face treatment, such as talking therapy, may become even more challenging than it currently is. If AI is too frequently used as a replacement for human contact, a decline in recovery rates and patient progress may occur as a result.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hands-reaching-1.jpg"                      alt="hands reaching out to each other"                ></p><p> At the moment, humans are seen as much more effective at conducting therapy than machines, and this may always be the case.

This is a big concern when AI is being entrusted with people’s mental health. Misjudging someone’s state of mind, offering ineffective treatment, or misinterpreting important data could be catastrophic for the patient, so there are major considerations that need to be made here.</p><p> There are plenty of things that can go wrong while using AI, particularly as it is in its early stages.

However, as is the case with any emerging technology, it is crucial that AI is not too quickly applied or outright misused. In mental healthcare, this could do more harm than good to patients. Time will tell if, or when, AI becomes a key element in the mental health industry and whether this turns out to be a blessing or a curse.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-instantaneously-showcasing-archived-video-sessions-via-facebook-live/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Instantaneously Showcasing Archived Video Sessions via Facebook Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-hidden-shotshaper-advanced-stealthy-methods-for-capturing-images/"><u>[New] In 2024, Hidden ShotShaper  Advanced Stealthy Methods for Capturing Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/new-social-media-synopsis-top-trending-twitvideos/"><u>[New] Social Media Synopsis  Top Trending TwitVideos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-cross-platform-sync-made-simple-post-tiktok-vids-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] Cross-Platform Sync Made Simple  Post TikTok Vids on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-crucial-techniques-for-documenting-lol-wars/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Crucial Techniques for Documenting LOL Wars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-perfecting-the-art-of-gif-to-sticker-transition-on-various-messaging-platforms/"><u>[Updated] Perfecting the Art of GIF to Sticker Transition on Various Messaging Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-secrets-in-watching-the-instagram-story-narrative-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Secrets in Watching  The Instagram Story Narrative for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-following-review-innovative-outlooks/"><u>2024 Approved  Following Review  Innovative Outlooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-vivo-y78-5g-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Vivo Y78 5G PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/best-3-vivo-v30-emulator-for-mac-to-run-your-wanted-android-apps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best 3 Vivo V30 Emulator for Mac to Run Your Wanted Android Apps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/comet-cache-corner-celestial-data-lifeline/"><u>Comet Cache Corner - Celestial Data Lifeline</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/expert-advice-on-securely-wiping-data-insights-from-stellar/"><u>Expert Advice on Securely Wiping Data - Insights From Stellar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/full-guide-on-mirroring-your-vivo-x100-pro-to-your-pcmac-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide on Mirroring Your Vivo X100 Pro to Your PC/Mac | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-can-vivo-y27-4gmirror-share-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How Can Vivo Y27 4GMirror Share to PC?

No story reply, group chat gossip, or work call will reach you as long as you have Do Not Disturb mode enabled on your iPhone.</p><p> However, if you’re still getting texts and calls on Do Not Disturb, it pretty much defeats the purpose of the feature. So, let’s look at the steps you can take when Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4726807&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_copy_power-tools-48.png"                      border="0"                >Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, Lifetime subscription</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode"><a href="#1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1.

Focus includes Do Not Disturb, Personal, Work, and so on. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/focus-mode-ideas-to-set-up-in-ios/" >set up different Focus modes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and customize them for different purposes.</p><p> If you accidentally enabled<strong>Work</strong> mode instead of<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> or<strong>Personal</strong> mode on your iPhone, you will certainly receive texts and calls from work colleagues because the latter wasn’t made to deter people from your workplace.</p><p> Therefore, before proceeding with the other suggestions in the list, access your iPhone’s<strong>Control Center</strong> and check that you have the correct Focus mode turned on to match your activity.</p><h2 id="2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps"><a href="#2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2.

For example, when working, you naturally wouldn’t want to miss notifications from collaborative apps like Slack and Asana.</p><p> But if you feel that Do Not Disturb is not working as it should, and you’re left wondering why you’re still getting notifications from apps you don’t want to hear from, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Apps</strong> to review the apps with allowed notifications.</p><p> Then, tap the<strong>minus (-)</strong> button to remove an unwanted app from the list. This way, it won’t bypass your Do Not Disturb mode anymore.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/focus-modes.JPEG"                      alt="focus modes on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-apps.JPEG"                      alt="allowed apps on do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ship7com.pxf.io/c/5597632/1509856/17634" target="_top" id="1509856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17634-1509856"                      border="0" alt="" width="730" height="383"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications"><a href="#3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you previously added quite a few family members and friends to your Favorites list, this may be why your iPhone calls are coming through even after you enabled Do Not Disturb, as if it’s not working.</p><p> To change this, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt; People</strong> . Now, tap on<strong>Allow Calls From</strong> and select your preferred option. If you want to only allow specific individuals to call you during Do Not Disturb mode, choose<strong>Allowed People Only</strong> and tap the<strong>Add</strong> button above to select your contacts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-favorite-calls.JPEG"                      alt="call settings for do not disturb mode on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-calls.JPEG"                      alt="change calls allowed on iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls"><a href="#5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls" class="headerlink" title="5.

This feature ensures that people can reach you in cases of emergencies, and it’s not because Do Not Disturb is not working.</p><p> But if there are people who call you mindlessly the moment you don’t pick up, and this feature ends up giving you more problems than convenience, you can choose to disable it.

So, if there’s a change in your routine, remember to check and adjust your Do Not Disturb schedule to fit accordingly.</p><p> Head to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings and tap on your existing schedule to edit it.

It occurs mostly because ACPI drivers supporting Hotkey service are not compatible with Windows 10. If you get this error, don’t worry. You can use one of the two solutions below to fix the error.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Update-ACPI-Drivers"><a href="#Method-1-Update-ACPI-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Update ACPI Drivers"></a><strong>Method 1: Update ACPI Drivers</strong></h2><p> ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is part of chipsets. So you can go to ASUS official website to download chipset drivers for Windows 10 depending on your PC model name. If ASUS does not support Windows 10 for your PC model, you can try downloading drivers for Windows 8 or Windows 7, which are always compatible for Windows 10.</p><p> If you don’t have time, patience or computer skills to update ACPI drivers manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):</p><ol><li><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>   and install Driver Easy.</p></li><li><p>Run Driver Easy and click <strong>Scan Now</strong> .

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme 12 5G to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time.

With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Realme 12 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.

Many mirror screening applications have been introduced and have been brought on the front to filter out the best in the market; however, the method involving sharing the screen to the PC or other associated devices have been recognized as quite simple and effective in performance. This article provides Realme 12 5G users, in specific, a list of solutions that can act as the easiest and the most convenient in allowing them to share their screen with a PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Need-Screen-Mirroring"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Need-Screen-Mirroring" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Need Screen Mirroring?"></a>Part 1: Why Need Screen Mirroring?</h2><p>If we consider the traditional and conventional methods of connecting AV cables, HDMI’s, or VGA adapters for connecting smaller screened devices to larger screens, these methods present too much work and a series of protocols that potentially outdated the system completely.

Another feature presented by AirMirror is its remote control, where you can control the Android device’s screen and operate different applications through a mouse and a keyboard. It even provides you the option of transferring files through a local network or the Internet. Conclusively, you can control every feature of the phone with the help of the computer’s remote control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/mirror-android-to-pc-2.jpg"                      alt="airmirror-interface"                ></p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>AirMirror provides a very user-friendly interface to its users.</li><li>This can be a very effective alternative to wired data transfer.

The diversity offered at AllCast Receiver is quite a treat for many users, with no costs. However, while using it, you need to understand the difference between AllCast and AllCast Receiver. These two applications are not the same by any means and have different dominions of installation. AllCast should be installed on the PC where you wish to mirror your screen, and AllCast Receiver should be installed on your Android phone, from where you have to share the screen onto another device. The application provides a vibrant feature set with the option of audio and video support during live streaming, along with the characteristics of photo sharing and screen sharing.

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Realme 12 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.
