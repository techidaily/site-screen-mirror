Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Nokia 150 (2023) deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop.

One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Nokia 150 (2023) deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Nokia 150 (2023) deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Nokia 150 (2023) devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Nokia 150 (2023) device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme GT 5 (240W) to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control.

Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these.

However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV.

However, I run into lag issues after a while. Sure this is over Wi-Fi, but it shouldn’t do that. I don’t have interference between my mobile &amp; Wi-Fi adapter. If it wasn’t for the lag, I’d give this 5 stars. The only fix I see is lowering the res, but I actually need HD.

The only two things I have to say is, for some reason, it might be my internet connection, but it won’t stream Hulu.

It works well, has a very low lag, good screen reproduction, and best of all, it doesn’t use a 3rd party system to send or receive messages. I’ve looked for an app like this, but others require rooting your phone or using a web-based system to control your phone through their servers. This app is the best I’ve found, with more than adequate performance.”</p><h3 id="6-AirDroid-Cast-Easy-Screen-Mirroring-of-Android-Under-Different-Scenarios"><a href="#6-AirDroid-Cast-Easy-Screen-Mirroring-of-Android-Under-Different-Scenarios" class="headerlink" title="6.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Cast-Oppo-A58-4G-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi"><a href="#How-to-Cast-Oppo-A58-4G-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="How to Cast Oppo A58 4G Screen to PC Using WiFi"></a>How to Cast Oppo A58 4G Screen to PC Using WiFi</h2><p>Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Oppo A58 4G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Oppo A58 4G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Oppo A58 4G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Oppo A58 4G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Oppo A58 4G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let’s try all of the options and choose one best!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/08/how-to-cast-android-screen-to-pc-using-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="screen mirroring android and casting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast"><a href="#Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast"></a>Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast</h2><p>For using this method, you will be required to create a personal Wi-Fi Hotspot.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Cast-Samsung-Galaxy-XCover-7-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi"><a href="#How-to-Cast-Samsung-Galaxy-XCover-7-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="How to Cast Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 Screen to PC Using WiFi"></a>How to Cast Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 Screen to PC Using WiFi</h2><p>Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let’s try all of the options and choose one best!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/08/how-to-cast-android-screen-to-pc-using-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="screen mirroring android and casting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast"><a href="#Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast"></a>Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast</h2><p>For using this method, you will be required to create a personal Wi-Fi Hotspot. Here you can follow this method in the following way:</p><p><strong>For Computer</strong>:</p><ul><li>Go to the ‘Search’ Bar.</li><li>Type ‘Connect’.</li><li>Open ‘Connect App.</li></ul><p>Here you will find suitable options for hotspot connection.</p><p><strong>For Android (Version 5,6, 7)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Go to ‘Settings’.</li><li>Choose ‘Display’.</li><li>Select ‘Cast’.</li><li>Then click on the three dots to view ‘Menu’.</li><li>Then choose the ‘Enable Wireless Display’ option.</li></ul><p><strong>For Android (Version 8)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Go to ‘Settings’.</li><li>Choose ‘Connected Devices’.</li><li>Select ‘Cast’.</li><li>Then click on the three dots to view ‘Menu’.</li><li>Then choose the ‘Enable Wireless Display’ option.</li></ul><p>Now you have to wait until and unless the Samsung Galaxy XCover 7 device is found.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Oppo Find N3 Flip to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers.

However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Cast-Vivo-Y100-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi"><a href="#How-to-Cast-Vivo-Y100-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="How to Cast Vivo Y100 Screen to PC Using WiFi"></a>How to Cast Vivo Y100 Screen to PC Using WiFi</h2><p>Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Vivo Y100 deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Vivo Y100 deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Vivo Y100 deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Vivo Y100 devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Vivo Y100 device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let’s try all of the options and choose one best!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/08/how-to-cast-android-screen-to-pc-using-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="screen mirroring android and casting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast"><a href="#Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast"></a>Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast</h2><p>For using this method, you will be required to create a personal Wi-Fi Hotspot.
