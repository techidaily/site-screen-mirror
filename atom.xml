You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly.</td><td>You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Realme 12+ 5G devices, saving you extra costs.</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>This article has provided an overview of the best methods available to <strong>mirror Realme 12+ 5G to Mac</strong> properly.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme GT Neo 5 device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme GT Neo 5 to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites. However, it is important for the users to note that they must be running Android 2.1 or later and also should have a working ZappoTV account setup if they are looking to use this app. Alongside, DLNA and UPnP connectivity is available through an internal purchase.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162549992.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Apple TV AirPlay Media Player"                ></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Twonky Beam:</strong> Here is the application that is ideal for streaming video apps. Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these. Sharing content between devices on the home network in the presence of an UPnP standard that is instrumental in helping users save media from their local network to the mobile device as the content is streamed on the Apple TV. However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV. Android users earlier used to complain about not having anything on the Apple TV for their device, but with these apps and many others that can one discover on the Google play store, things have got better. Let us know in the comment section, how was your experience of streaming content from your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><h2 id="How-to-Cast-Realme-GT-Neo-5-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi"><a href="#How-to-Cast-Realme-GT-Neo-5-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="How to Cast Realme GT Neo 5 Screen to PC Using WiFi"></a>How to Cast Realme GT Neo 5 Screen to PC Using WiFi</h2><p>Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people.

In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme GT Neo 5 SE to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites. However, it is important for the users to note that they must be running Android 2.1 or later and also should have a working ZappoTV account setup if they are looking to use this app. Alongside, DLNA and UPnP connectivity is available through an internal purchase.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162549992.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Apple TV AirPlay Media Player"                ></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Twonky Beam:</strong> Here is the application that is ideal for streaming video apps. Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these. Sharing content between devices on the home network in the presence of an UPnP standard that is instrumental in helping users save media from their local network to the mobile device as the content is streamed on the Apple TV. However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV. Android users earlier used to complain about not having anything on the Apple TV for their device, but with these apps and many others that can one discover on the Google play store, things have got better.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme 12 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme V30 to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time.

For instance, you can mirror your Android phone screen on the computer and the other way round. In this article, viewers will get to know how to mirror an Android screen on PC wirelessly or through a USB cable.</p><p>Screen Mirroring is quite useful in many ways. It allows you to display the screen of your Android phone, tablet, or PC on another device through a wired or wireless connection between both devices.

In the case of screen mirroring Poco X6 PC, this could be done through both wireless and wired connections. At the same time, screen mirroring can be done when one device continuously sends the copy of its screen to another targeted device simultaneously.</p><p>In a meeting or presentation, screen mirroring plays an important role by facilitating team members to avoid complex setups and share their screens immediately. Moreover, screen mirroring supports the BYOD model, that is, “Bring Your Own Device.” The reason for supporting this model is to lower the cost and increase efficiency.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Prerequisites-for-Android-Screen-Mirroring"><a href="#Part-2-Prerequisites-for-Android-Screen-Mirroring" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Prerequisites for Android Screen Mirroring"></a>Part 2: Prerequisites for Android Screen Mirroring</h2><p>To successfully cast Android screen to PC, the screen mirroring apps should work properly.

The steps of settings for enabling both developer options and USB debugging are discussed below:</p><p><strong>Enable Developer option</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Settings” app on your Android phone and choose “System” settings from the list. Now click on the “About Phone” option from the top of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, you need to scroll down and click the “Build Number” option five times.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Proceed back on the “System” settings, where you will find a “Developer” option present.</p><p><strong>Enable USB Debugging</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, open your Android phone “Settings” and go to “System” settings. Now click on the “Developers” option on the next screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now go down and turn on the “USB Debugging” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/07/guide-to-android-wireless-and-wired-screen-mirroring-2.jpg"                      alt="enable usb debugging"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Efficient-and-Fast-Wireless-Android-Screen-Mirroring-Tool-MirrorGo"><a href="#Part-4-Efficient-and-Fast-Wireless-Android-Screen-Mirroring-Tool-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Efficient and Fast Wireless Android Screen Mirroring Tool - MirrorGo"></a>Part 4: Efficient and Fast Wireless Android Screen Mirroring Tool - MirrorGo</h2><p>If you are looking for an advanced experience of mirroring your Android device with the PC, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features an intelligent solution with efficiency.

It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Poco X6 to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone’s battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Poco X6 to your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Initiate USB Debugging on your Phone</strong></p><p>You need to have USB debugging enabled on your phone to connect your Poco X6 through the ADB connection. If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Open Command Prompt on PC</strong></p><p>Turn on the Command Prompt on your PC to initiate an ADB command terminal. For that, you need to type in ‘adb tcpip 5556’ to restart ADB in TCPIP mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-1.jpg"                      alt="type-the-command"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Locate your IP Address</strong></p><p>Following this, you need to locate the IP address of your Xiaomi. If you have a phone with an OS version below 6.0, type in:</p><p>Adb shell</p><p>Netcfg</p><p>Conversely, for phones greater than Android 7, sulk in:</p><p>Adb shell</p><p>ifconfig</p><p>A list shall appear on the Command Prompt, showing a list of all the local IP addresses associated with the computer. You need to locate the IP address of your Poco X6 Android phone and have it copied on the clipboard.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Close and Re-Type IP Address</strong></p><p>You need to exit the ADB window to re-type the IP address for connecting your PC with the phone. Type ‘ADB shell’ to exit the window; however, keep the terminal open. Retype the IP address on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-2.jpg"                      alt="retype-your-ip-address"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Remove USB Cable and Confirm Connection</strong></p><p>Following this, you need to remove the USB cable and continue using your phone using the ADB connection through the Wi-Fi and Hotspot connection of your phone. To confirm, you can check the Poco X6 device connected through Vysor to observe it active on the list. You can simply connect to the phone in a normal manner for screen mirroring Poco X6 to PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-3.jpg"                      alt="check-your-device-from-the-list"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-Screen-Mirroring-Poco-X6-to-PC-with-Mi-PC-Suite"><a href="#Part-5-Screen-Mirroring-Poco-X6-to-PC-with-Mi-PC-Suite" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Screen Mirroring Poco X6 to PC with Mi PC Suite"></a>Part 5: Screen Mirroring Poco X6 to PC with Mi PC Suite</h2><p><strong>Step 1: Download Mi PC Suite</strong></p><p>To successfully screen share your Poco X6 to PC, you can access the official website of Mi PC Suite to have it downloaded on the PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Launch the PC Suite</strong></p><p>After downloading the application, you need to simply launch it and observe the screen on the front showing the option of Connect your Device.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Amplifi HD is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-mesh-wi-fi-network-systems-4139748" >Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a main router and separate mesh points that serve as satellite routers. The Amplifi system is supposed to extend Wi-Fi range, reduce dead zones, and provide better coverage. To see how Ubiquiti’s mesh system holds up to the demands of a household with multiple devices, I connected the Amplifi HD in my test home that contains roughly 50 Wi-Fi connected devices.</p><h2 id="Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points"><a href="#Design-A-beautiful-router-with-mismatched-mesh-points" class="headerlink" title="Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points"></a><strong>Design: A beautiful router with mismatched mesh points</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD Mesh System comes with a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >long-range router <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and two satellite mesh points. The router has a unique design. It’s small, cube-shaped, and it looks more like an alarm clock or smart display than a router. It doesn’t have antennas protruding from it as you see on most routers.</p><p> The router measures 3.9 inches by 3.9 inches and its matte white with an LCD touchscreen and a light around the bottom perimeter. The router is stylish, yet unassuming. You can set it on a table or entertainment center, and it’ll go unnoticed.</p><p> The two satellite points are very simplistic. They are basic looking, oval-shaped devices with no ports. They plug into a wall outlet, and they have indicator lights to tell you the signal strength. The mesh points, aside from being the same matte-white color, don’t match very well with the main router. Fortunately, they sit in different areas of the home, so the mismatched design doesn’t have too much impact on the overall aesthetic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/s87ZCkRIGWmpbjF2kUOXJRQtOl4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Amplifi_LongRangeRouters_HD_02-1a111a806ad7495ba9f36d51121fe5b0.jpg"                      alt="Amplifi HD"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Erika Rawes</p><h2 id="Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier"><a href="#Setup-Couldn’t-get-any-easier" class="headerlink" title="Setup: Couldn’t get any easier"></a><strong>Setup: Couldn’t get any easier</strong></h2><p> The setup for the Amplifi HD system is probably the easiest setup process I’ve encountered. The app walks you through the process step-by-step, with pictures to guide you on each instruction. The most difficult part was deciding where to place the two mesh points in my test home. I placed one in the far bedroom and one in my office, two rooms that notoriously experience drop-offs.</p><p> By default, the app creates a dual (2.4 and 5Ghz) network, which directs traffic based on the most efficient pathways. You can create separate 2.4 and 5Ghz networks, or make other adjustments as you see fit though. You can change the band on the mesh points (from 2.4 to 5Ghz), create additional SSIDs, and more. For the purpose of testing, I used the default combined network and allowed the system to direct network traffic between bands.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557747/17382" target="_top" id="1557747">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557747" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557747/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices"><a href="#Connectivity-Lags-when-you-add-too-many-devices" class="headerlink" title="Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices"></a><strong>Connectivity: Lags when you add too many devices</strong></h2><p> The Amplifi HD system is not Wi-Fi 6 capable.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wireless-standards-802-11a-802-11b-g-n-and-802-11ac-816553" >It has 802.11ac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s backwards compatible. On the back of the router sit four gigabit LAN ports in addition to the WAN connection. There’s no multigig port, but the four ports were a welcome addition.</p><p> The Amplifi HD seems to be designed for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-long-range-routers-4122554" >optimal signal range <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , as opposed to device quantity. This is an ideal system for someone with a large area to cover, but it’s not a powerhouse capable of managing an army of devices like the Nighthawk AX12 or the TP-Link Archer AX6000. The Amplifi system thrives in terms of its ability to push a signal over a long distance, as it can cover areas up to 20,000 square feet. The Amplifi system doesn’t exactly thrive in its ability to manage dozens of devices simultaneously.</p><p> In my test home, speeds from my ISP max out at 500 Mbps. In the same room as the main router, Ookla measured the speed at 131 Mbps. The speed remained consistent throughout the home, even in rooms that typically experience drop offs with other routers. However, outside in the backyard, the speed reduced to 111 Mbps.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1828647/21290" target="_top" id="1828647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1828647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1828647/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Key-Features-A-display-screen"><a href="#Key-Features-A-display-screen" class="headerlink" title="Key Features: A display screen"></a><strong>Key Features: A display screen</strong></h2><p> The touchscreen on the front of the main router can display the time, total GB, WAN and Router IP addresses, internet speeds, and port statuses.

The package I tested, which came with the router and two mesh points, retails for $340. You can find mesh systems for much less, and of course, some mesh systems are much more expensive. But, the Amplifi system’s design, easy setup, and feature set help justify the price.</p><h2 id="Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi"><a href="#Amplifi-HD-vs-Nest-Wi-Fi" class="headerlink" title="Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi"></a><strong>Amplifi HD vs. Nest Wi-Fi</strong></h2><p> A Nest Wi-Fi package sells for around the same price as the Amplifi system. However, with the Nest system, all of the components match, while the Amplifi router looks very different from its mesh points.
