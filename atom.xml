Android to Android mirroring is amazing, and you just might want to try it out. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even mobile hotspots.</p><p>While there are many tools for android to android mirroring, this example will use ScreenShare, which uses ScreenShare Technology to allow two android to android mirror through Bluetooth, mobile hotspots, or Wi-Fi. This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets.

Also, a “Connected” status should appear for your other device in the paired Devices list. In the circumstance that you fail to connect the first time, you will be required to wait for at least 10 to 20 seconds, after which you will have to try step 4 and 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/mirror-android-to-android-pic2.jpg"                      alt="Android to android mirroring through Bluetooth"                ></p><p>After the above steps have been done successfully, your devices will have been mirrored successfully, and you can now start to enjoy the experience that comes with it.

Most of the tools can be downloaded online for free, while others are for a fee. Some of the most popular tools include; Air Playit, Optia, MirrorOp, PeerDeviceNet. Sampling the tools and getting the best that suits the experience you desire is also a good idea, or you can look up the reviews that have been written by other users, and you can pick one or two issues you like or dislike. Most, if not all the tools, have manuals that can even help you get started as they might defer a bit from the ScreenShare example given in this article.</p><h2 id="Top-10-AirPlay-Apps-in-Realme-12-Pro-5G-for-Streaming"><a href="#Top-10-AirPlay-Apps-in-Realme-12-Pro-5G-for-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Realme 12 Pro+ 5G for Streaming"></a>Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Realme 12 Pro+ 5G for Streaming</h2><p>AirPlay has changed the way people stream their music and other media content over several devices over a common wireless network. With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983474">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983474">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983474.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983474%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983474/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices.

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme 12+ 5G to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites.

Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these. Sharing content between devices on the home network in the presence of an UPnP standard that is instrumental in helping users save media from their local network to the mobile device as the content is streamed on the Apple TV. However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme GT 5 to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites. However, it is important for the users to note that they must be running Android 2.1 or later and also should have a working ZappoTV account setup if they are looking to use this app. Alongside, DLNA and UPnP connectivity is available through an internal purchase.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162549992.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Apple TV AirPlay Media Player"                ></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Twonky Beam:</strong> Here is the application that is ideal for streaming video apps. Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these. Sharing content between devices on the home network in the presence of an UPnP standard that is instrumental in helping users save media from their local network to the mobile device as the content is streamed on the Apple TV. However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV. Android users earlier used to complain about not having anything on the Apple TV for their device, but with these apps and many others that can one discover on the Google play store, things have got better.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme GT 5 (240W) device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade.

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme Note 50 device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need.

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices.

But with this growing AI prevalence, should you be at all concerned about your mental health? Will AI improve or worsen mental health across the board?</p><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Improve-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Improve-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Improve Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Improve Mental Health?</h2><p> AI is already a big deal in a number of industries, including healthcare, transport, and finance. But you may not know that AI is also being experimented with in the mental health realm.</p><p> Through this, researchers may be able to find new ways of supporting mental health patients and developing better forms of treatment. At the time of writing, AI is still in its infancy in terms of mental health applications, but this technology has a lot of potential in the mental healthcare industry.</p><p> So, how, exactly, might AI prove useful here, and in what ways may it pose a risk?</p><h3 id="Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI"><a href="#Providing-Instant-Advice-and-Support-Using-AI" class="headerlink" title="Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI"></a>Providing Instant Advice and Support Using AI</h3><p> Finding a therapist can take a long time, and can even be an inaccessible option for some due to its high cost. So, when someone needs advice and support immediately, who can they turn to?</p><p> There are hotlines for those seeking support, but talking to a real person about your problems can be daunting. So, using artificial intelligence, an individual may be able to access advice remotely without having to talk to a real person. This can alleviate the social anxiety associated with discussing personal issues, while also ensuring that the person struggling receives some form of support.</p><p> While regular chatbots can be used in such a scenario, an AI-powered chatbot will likely have the ability to communicate in a more personal way, further understand a person’s issue, and provide possible solutions or avenues. We’ve already seen how the<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chat-gpt-generative-ai-explained/" >ChatGPT chatbot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can interact with users, so there’s likely some potential here for patient support.</p><p> Of course, some may see<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dangers-using-ai-free-therapist-psychiatrist/" >using AI to provide mental health advice as risky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

While a human professional can do this well, the number of individuals requiring mental health support makes it difficult for human personnel to keep up with the demand.</p><p> This is where AI might be able to help. Using this technology, a patient could give inputs on how they’re feeling and what they’ve been doing, and an AI system could then assess and evaluate the information provided to determine whether there is any cause for concern. The AI system could then alert the relevant parties so that action can be taken. This may lower the occurrences of mental health negligence, as a far greater number of people could be assessed regularly without the need for a human professional.</p><p> But there are risks to consider here, and the AI system in use would have to be very thoroughly trained on how to spot possible red flags. Still, simply using this as an initial assessment could prove highly beneficial, both to doctors and patients.</p><h3 id="Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI"><a href="#Developing-New-Support-Techniques-With-AI" class="headerlink" title="Developing New Support Techniques With AI"></a>Developing New Support Techniques With AI</h3><p> There’s no denying that researchers are still working to further understand our brains and why they give way to mental illnesses. Not only is the origin of mental illness still being researched, but techniques on how to better treat patients are also being developed.</p><p> For example, an AI system may be able to take a batch of data about patient symptoms, triggers, or backgrounds, and then suggest new ways to help them make progress. This could be a medication suggestion, a kind of therapy, or similar.</p><p> On top of this, AI has been proven to detect the presence of mental illnesses with a relatively high rate of accuracy. In a<a class="link"   href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt9gx593b0/qt9gx593b0%5FnoSplash%5Fd814b6b41c76cb874050695d2bf30ced.pdf" >2019 psychiatry report by IBM and the University of California <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it was stated that, when testing AI in mental illness detection, accuracy ranged from 62 to 92 percent (depending on the AI system and training data used). While the lower ends of this range aren’t too impressive, continued development may allow AI systems to reach a consistently high accuracy rate when detecting mental illnesses.</p><p> Though this all seems very promising, there are also<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/is-ai-dangerous-5-immediate-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/" >dangers associated with using AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in the mental health field and other ways that AI can worsen mental health in general.</p><h2 id="How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health"><a href="#How-Can-AI-Worsen-Mental-Health" class="headerlink" title="How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?"></a>How Can AI Worsen Mental Health?</h2><p> While AI has significant potential to improve mental healthcare, there are also risks and dangers in the adoption of this fast-evolving technology.</p><h3 id="Increased-Reliance-on-AI"><a href="#Increased-Reliance-on-AI" class="headerlink" title="Increased Reliance on AI"></a>Increased Reliance on AI</h3><p> Over the past few decades, the rise of smart technology has led many people to rely on phones, PCs, tablets, and other devices to simplify and enhance their lives. Whether they’re chatting on social media, streaming movies, browsing for new clothes, or simply getting some work done, technology usually stands as the backbone. Many people are even<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/smartphone-addiction-how-overcome-negative-habit/" >addicted to their smartphones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or computers, which can have a huge impact on their lives.</p><p> So, when AI becomes prominent across various industries, it could have a detrimental effect on mental health. For instance, an individual may opt to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-teachers-embrace-ai/" >use AI for their education <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , work, entertainment, and other elements of their social life. This, in turn, may lead to something of an AI addiction. There are already plenty of people addicted to social media, online shopping, and online gaming today, which can often give way to feelings of anxiety and very real social and financial problems.</p><h3 id="Lack-of-Human-Contact"><a href="#Lack-of-Human-Contact" class="headerlink" title="Lack of Human Contact"></a>Lack of Human Contact</h3><p> Humans are, by nature, social beings. So, it can often be hugely beneficial to discuss your feelings with somebody else, instead of dealing with them alone.</p><p> But if AI becomes increasingly used in the mental health industry, accessing face-to-face treatment, such as talking therapy, may become even more challenging than it currently is. If AI is too frequently used as a replacement for human contact, a decline in recovery rates and patient progress may occur as a result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hands-reaching-1.jpg"                      alt="hands reaching out to each other"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094480/7443" target="_top" id="2094480">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094480" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094480/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> At the moment, humans are seen as much more effective at conducting therapy than machines, and this may always be the case. This is why the application of AI in the mental health field should be regulated and monitored very carefully so that patients are still receiving the best care possible.</p><h3 id="AI-Giving-Faulty-Advice-or-Solutions"><a href="#AI-Giving-Faulty-Advice-or-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="AI Giving Faulty Advice or Solutions"></a>AI Giving Faulty Advice or Solutions</h3><p> While AI is capable of some amazing things, it is also vulnerable to errors. This is a big concern when AI is being entrusted with people’s mental health. Misjudging someone’s state of mind, offering ineffective treatment, or misinterpreting important data could be catastrophic for the patient, so there are major considerations that need to be made here.</p><p> There are plenty of things that can go wrong while using AI, particularly as it is in its early stages.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme Note 50 to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites. However, it is important for the users to note that they must be running Android 2.1 or later and also should have a working ZappoTV account setup if they are looking to use this app. Alongside, DLNA and UPnP connectivity is available through an internal purchase.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162549992.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Apple TV AirPlay Media Player"                ></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Twonky Beam:</strong> Here is the application that is ideal for streaming video apps. Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these.

One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or a faulty sound card driver.</p><p> There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update your sound card driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your computer, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy</strong></a> .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact sound card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:</p><ol><li>Download and install<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy</strong></a> .</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button.
