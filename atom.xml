Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135418/19272" target="_top" id="2135418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135418/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118315/7443" target="_top" id="2118315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118315/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddpai-mini3-review-4770579" >DDpai mini3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rexing-v1-dashcam-review-4770571" >Rexing V1 DashCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C450 Dash Cam</li><li>Product Brand  Apeman</li><li>MPN  X0023JN4OL</li><li>Price  $39.99</li><li>Weight  12 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.3 x 4.2 x 3.8 in.</li><li>Camera  170-degree FOV, WDR</li><li>Recording Quality  1080p</li><li>Crash Detection  Yes</li><li>Parking Mode  Yes</li><li>Connectivity options  USB</li><li>Storage  Up to 32GB SDHC card (Class 10)</li><li>Warranty  12 months</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-your-youtube-comments-with-emoji-skills/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevating Your YouTube Comments with Emoji Skills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-snapchats-emojis-more-than-just-fun/"><u>[Updated] Understanding Snapchat's Emojis More Than Just Fun</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-9-android-apps-minimize-videos-effortlessly-and-costlessly/"><u>2024 Approved Best 9 Android Apps Minimize Videos Effortlessly and Costlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/boosting-your-fps-on-ark-survival-evolved-for-an-optimal-pc-gaming-experience/"><u>Boosting Your FPS on ARK: Survival Evolved for an Optimal PC Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-overcome-the-error-code-6-challenge-in-call-of-dutys-pc-version/"><u>How to Overcome the Error Code 6 Challenge in Call of Duty's PC Version</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/laptop-keyboard-malfunction-heres-what-you-can-do-to-fix-it/"><u>Laptop Keyboard Malfunction?

It occurs mostly because ACPI drivers supporting Hotkey service are not compatible with Windows 10. If you get this error, don’t worry. You can use one of the two solutions below to fix the error.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Update-ACPI-Drivers"><a href="#Method-1-Update-ACPI-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Update ACPI Drivers"></a><strong>Method 1: Update ACPI Drivers</strong></h2><p> ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is part of chipsets. So you can go to ASUS official website to download chipset drivers for Windows 10 depending on your PC model name. If ASUS does not support Windows 10 for your PC model, you can try downloading drivers for Windows 8 or Windows 7, which are always compatible for Windows 10.</p><p> If you don’t have time, patience or computer skills to update ACPI drivers manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):</p><ol><li><p><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>   and install Driver Easy.</p></li><li><p>Run Driver Easy and click <strong>Scan Now</strong> .

While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well.

A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant.

Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice.

However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity.

It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device?

While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well.

Read on for our full take.</em></p><p> Nvidia’s RTX 30 series is the hottest thing in PC gaming right now. So hot, in fact, that it’s almost impossible to buy a desktop RTX 30 series graphics card, and even laptops with the hardware are flying off store shelves.</p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is, in many respects, a mid-range gaming laptop, but it succeeds at one very important task: it delivers Nvidia RTX 3060 Max-Q at a reasonable price, and it’s actually in stock not just at, but sometimes below, MSRP. Its value pricing helps the Triton 300 SE stand out against attractive competitors like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14.</p><h2 id="Design-Small-but-sturdy"><a href="#Design-Small-but-sturdy" class="headerlink" title="Design: Small but sturdy"></a>Design: Small but sturdy</h2><p> I’m surprised Acer didn’t slap a “Pro” label on the Predator Triton 300 SE. The spec sheet might scream gaming, but the laptop’s look and feel has more in common with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-laptops-to-buy-4043650" >business laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The aluminum exterior and simple silver interior keep this laptop subtle. It’s a bit dull, actually, compared to the sleek elegance of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/razer-book-13-review-5176895" >Razer’s Book 13 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or the brash look of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The Triton 300 SE measures 0.7 inches thick and weighs a hair less than 3.5 pounds. These figures aren’t unusual in 2021 but are impressive for a laptop packing serious gaming horsepower. It will easily fit in most backpacks or messenger bags, yet packs performance to rival modern game consoles.</p><p> It’s a sturdy little beast, too. The chassis feels slate-like in hand. Holding the laptop up by one corner reveals nearly no flex. The display is the weak point; opening the laptops can cause a few creaks and groans.</p><p> Physical connectivity is a mix of new and old. There are two USB-A 3.2 ports paired with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port that supports DisplayPort Mode and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-thunderbolt-832713" >Thunderbolt 4 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There’s also an HDMI output and a 3.5mm audio jack that handles audio-in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RkOepytb4JglYF6g8lqap4lR4Uk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-5-b8c978f2d42a4865be1ea11a4785c104.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> All the laptop’s ports are placed near the front of the chassis. You’ll have to deal with tangled cables more often than with a laptop that places most ports on the rear. I found this annoying when using an external mouse, as cables jutting from the laptop’s flanks often bumped my hand while playing games.</p><h2 id="What’s-New-This-one-is-special"><a href="#What’s-New-This-one-is-special" class="headerlink" title="What’s New: This one is special"></a>What’s New: This one is special</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE has little in common with other Predator Triton or Helios models. A few common design elements can be found in the speaker grill, fans, and PreadtorSense software, but the design is otherwise distinct.</p><h2 id="Display-Better-than-first-glance"><a href="#Display-Better-than-first-glance" class="headerlink" title="Display: Better than first glance"></a>Display: Better than first glance</h2><p> I wasn’t immediately impressed by the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s display. It’s not especially bright and has a matte coating, so lacks the brilliant, eye-catching look that is common to high-end laptops with glossy, high-brightness displays.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played.</p><p> Once I loaded a game, though, I liked what I saw. The screen’s resolution is 1080p, but that’s more than enough to provide a sharp, crisp look in modern games. It also supports a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-refresh-rate-2625984" >maximum refresh rate of 144Hz <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , providing an ultra-smooth look in older titles capable of achieving a high framerate.</p><p> The display delivers impressive contrast and vibrant color for a mid-range gaming laptop. I noticed this in every game I played. Games with bright, high-color graphics look vivid, while those with a moody tone look dark and foreboding.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/eRv5Q4rKutM9zrhSTCRxbBO4rVc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-6-2af7f9999ae847bda4f5b9b830c9c555.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> There’s one downside: poor viewing angles. This is unusual in a modern laptop, though I’ve noticed this trait in many high-refresh laptop displays. I can’t give the Triton 300 SE too much flak for this given its otherwise excellent performance.</p><h2 id="Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else"><a href="#Performance-Great-for-games-ok-for-everything-else" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else"></a>Performance: Great for games, ok for everything else</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s most unusual feature is its Intel Core i7-11375H processor. It’s odd because it has just four cores (running eight threads) but is still sold as a top-tier component. The Core i7-11375H has higher minimum and maximum clock speeds than the comparable Intel Core i7-1165G7 found in thinner notebooks. The i7-11375H can clock as high as 5GHz. My review unit also had 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state hard drive.</p><p> PCMark 10 hit an overall score of 5,534. Geekbench 5 turned in a single-core score of 1,418 and a multi-core score of 4,493. The Geekbench 5 multi-core score is behind the curve;<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amd-vs-intel-which-processor-is-best-for-you-4780276" >new AMD Ryzen 7 5000-series laptops <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can almost double that result. This will disappoint content creators who use CPU-dependent applications. The Acer Triton 300 SE won’t keep up with AMD-powered rivals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, in such workloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/_blPSVdy574t15clSGhbK6JH68o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-4-5a097b76e29b4ee985eee421ed6d0fe8.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> Gaming performance proved more impressive. 3DMark Fire Strike hit a score of 14,462, while Time Spy hit a score of 6,721. The laptop averaged 143 FPS in the GFXBench Car Chase test. It also averaged 74 frames per second in Shadow of the Tomb Raider at high detail with ray-traced shadows off.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ray-tracing-5097484" >Turning ray-traced shadows on <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> reduced the average to 56 frames per second.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution.</p><p> These numbers may seem disappointing if compared to all RTX 3060 laptops. You can expect more from Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 and the Razer Blade 15. But don’t forget the price. Acer’s laptop significantly undercuts those alternatives. When compared to all gaming laptops, this Acer delivers great performance for the price.</p><p> For me, the Triton 300 SE is easily fast enough: it can handle most games at an average of 60 frames per second (fps), and often much higher, at 1080p resolution. I wouldn’t recommend the Triton 300 SE if you plan to use an external 1440p or 4K monitor, however. Pushing a higher pixel count will lead to sub-60fps performance in most demanding games.</p><h2 id="Productivity-All-business"><a href="#Productivity-All-business" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: All business"></a>Productivity: All business</h2><p> The Acer Predator Triton 300 SE’s business-like design carries over to the keyboard and mouse. Key feel is good, with significant key travel and firm bottoming action, and the spacious layout will be comfortable for most users.</p><p> There is a flaw: some keys are smaller than they could be. The Control, Function, and Windows keys are noticeable examples. It’s an odd decision that can cause confusion when hunting for a keyboard shortcut.</p><p> Keyboard backlighting is standard and set to white by default, but the color can be customized across three zones. It’s not as impressive as the per-key RGB backlighting found on some gaming laptops but I’m happy to see some customization offered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/IiMzYmVU-_I6PnObn0bkjyCzqUk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-3-7cae0e5d13154048bbc93c40976706ca.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><p> The touchpad is about four inches wide and two and a half inches deep. That’s not bad for a gaming laptop, but average for a productivity machine, and it can feel cramped. It’s responsive and rejects any quick, unintended brush by a palm or thumb. It’s smooth when using multi-touch gestures like two-finger scroll or pinch-to-zoom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2121335/18498" target="_top" id="2121335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2121335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2121335/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Packing-a-punch"><a href="#Audio-Packing-a-punch" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Packing a punch"></a>Audio: Packing a punch</h2><p> This laptop packs a sonic punch.

It has an upwards-facing speaker that provides clear, crisp sound in games, music, or podcasts.</p><p> There are limits, of course. It isn’t loud enough to project impressive volume in a living room or kitchen. It can also sound muddy and confused when playing bass-forward music or the most frantic action games. Still, it’s an impressive set of speakers that will rarely leave you wanting for more.</p><h2 id="Network-Killer-performance"><a href="#Network-Killer-performance" class="headerlink" title="Network: Killer performance"></a>Network: Killer performance</h2><p> Downloading a big, hot new game can be a real hassle, especially over Wi-Fi, but the Triton 300 SE can help. It has Intel’s Killer Wi-Fi 6 AX1650 and let me tell you: this thing rips.</p><p> It delivered network speeds of over 800 megabits per second (Mbps) near my router, which is typical. Every<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345#:~:text=Wi%2DFi%206%20is%20the,Fi%20faster%20and%20more%20reliable." >Wi-Fi 6 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> laptop I review manages that. I was impressed by its performance in my detached office, where the Triton 300 SE hit up to 195Mbps. By comparison, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-5179212" >Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Titanium <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> hit only 40Mbps in the same space.</p><p> This translated to excellent real-world results. I created a real-world stress test by downloading Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam while simultaneously downloading Metro Exodus on Epic. Surprisingly, both downloads averaged in excess of 25Mbps. I’m used to seeing numbers in the teens.</p><h2 id="Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam"><a href="#Camera-BYOW-Bring-Your-Own-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)"></a>Camera: BYOW (Bring Your Own Webcam)</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE straddles the line between entertainment and productivity in its design, but the camera falls short of its professional aspirations. It’s a tiny 720p pinhole camera that squeezes between the display and the top bezel. Video quality is grainy in all but the brightest rooms and uneven lighting can easily confuse it.</p><h2 id="Battery-Ouch"><a href="#Battery-Ouch" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Ouch"></a>Battery: Ouch</h2><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story. This is a powerful laptop yet, due to its size, it contains a modest 60 watt-hour battery. That would be fine in a laptop without discrete graphics, but this is a gaming laptop.</p><p> I didn’t expect much endurance and received even less. My first effort at using the Triton 300 SE for a workday of writing had me reaching for the power brick after 3 hours. Two further workdays put me at about 3 hours, 30 minutes each.</p><p> It’s easy to pack the Acer Predator Triton 300 SE in a bag for travel, but keeping it charged is a different story.</p><p> In fairness to Acer, there’s little it could do to fix this issue. A slim gaming laptop sucks down a lot of juice even outside of games, yet there’s not much room for a battery. The majority of gaming laptops I’ve tested in recent years have delivered less than 4 hours of real-world endurance, and the worst won’t last 2 hours.</p><p> Still, buyer beware. The Triton 300 SE might look like a productivity laptop, but its battery life is solidly in the realm of full-blown gaming machines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/RSfl2dEVmErlvh3BUUFcxqsbt9w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-Gaming-Laptop-2-c5eed4bfe7e44014952b5503566097d9.jpg"                      alt="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Matthew S. Smith</p><h2 id="Software-Planet-what-now"><a href="#Software-Planet-what-now" class="headerlink" title="Software: Planet what now?"></a>Software: Planet what now?</h2><p> Acer ships the Predator Triton 300 SE with Windows 10 Home. It includes a few touches exclusive to Acer, including a Planet9 wallpaper and a few other icons under the same.</p><p> Despite this, most laptop functions are controlled through the PredatorSense software interface. It can control fan modes, adjust keyboard lighting, and monitor temperatures, among other functions. PredatorSense is not much to look at, but I find it less confusing than the alternatives from Asus and Razer.</p><p> The laptop comes with Norton antivirus installed. It’s eager to remind you of its presence whenever you download a file or visit an unfamiliar website. The antivirus is easy to uninstall, but its presence takes away from what otherwise feels like a special laptop in Acer’s Predator line.</p><h2 id="Price-An-outstanding-value"><a href="#Price-An-outstanding-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: An outstanding value"></a>Price: An outstanding value</h2><p> Acer sells the Predator Triton 300 SE for $1,400, and it sometimes sells for $1,350 at Best Buy. This is an outstanding price for a laptop packing Nvidia’s RTX 3060. There’s only a few competitors with the RTX 3060, such as MSI’s GF65 Thin, that can be purchased for less right now. The MSI GF65 manages to undercut the Triton 300 SE by using an older Intel chip and just 8GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14"><a href="#Acer-Predator-Triton-300-SE-vs-Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G14" class="headerlink" title="Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14"></a>Acer Predator Triton 300 SE vs. Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</h2><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE and Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 seem to target the same users. They’re both compact, light 14-inch laptops that pack impressive CPU and GPU horsepower. Although great for gamers, they also appeal to content creators seeking an affordable, portable laptop.</p><p> The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 wins out in design and build quality. It’s an attractive, eye-catching laptop that feels more solid than the already respectable Triton 300 SE. The two laptops trade blows in display, keyboard, touchpad, and connectivity, with neither having a significant edge.</p><p> Game performance is similar, but the Asus G14 embraces AMD processors with up to eight cores. A well-equipped G14 will easily trounce the Acer in multi-core processor tests. Game performance is roughly similar when both are configured with an RTX 3060 graphics chip, with the Asus G14 having a slight edge.</p><p> While the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a better laptop overall, price is a factor. The Asus G14 is sold for $1,500 when configured with Nvidia’s RTX 3060 and is harder to find in stock. Paying a bit more for the Asus G14 makes sense to content creators who need its superior processor performance, but gamers could find more value in Acer’s alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Excellent value for an RTX-powered gaming laptop.</strong></p><p> Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE is an excellent value that has what gamers want: a great gaming experience and a quality display. Its short battery life and mediocre multi-core processor hold it back in everyday use, but the laptop’s competitive price makes these flaws easy to forgive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139120/17108" target="_top" id="2139120">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139120" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139120/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-review-5069584" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-review-4795686" >Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-4779760" >Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Predator Triton 300 SE</li><li>Product Brand  Acer</li><li>MPN  PT314-51s-71UU</li><li>Price  $1,399.00</li><li>Release Date  March 2021</li><li>Weight  3.75 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  12.7 x 9 x 0.7 in.</li><li>Color  Silver</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>Platform  Windows 10</li><li>Processor  Intel Core i7-11375H</li><li>RAM  16GB</li><li>Storage  512GB</li><li>Camera  720p</li><li>Battery Capacity  60 watt-hour</li><li>Ports  1x USB-C 3.2 with DisplayPort mode and ThunderBolt 4, 2x USB-A 3.2, 1x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-discover-top-emulated-psp-classics-on-ios/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Discover Top Emulated PSP Classics on iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-leverage-youtube-metrics-for-enhanced-visibility/"><u>[Updated] Leverage YouTube Metrics for Enhanced Visibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/boosting-your-fps-on-ark-survival-evolved-for-an-optimal-pc-gaming-experience/"><u>Boosting Your FPS on ARK: Survival Evolved for an Optimal PC Gaming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/effortless-methods-to-silence-that-annoying-buzzy-sound-in-your-audio-system/"><u>Effortless Methods to Silence That Annoying Buzzy Sound in Your Audio System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-apple-iphone-13-pro-max-device-from-icloud-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max Device from iCloud</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-toolwiz-photography-companion-a-thorough-2023-breakdown/"><u>In 2024, Toolwiz Photography Companion A Thorough 2023 Breakdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/invest-in-your-health-these-10-best-yoga-streams-exist/"><u>Invest in Your Health -

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme C67 4G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device?
