With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity.

The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet.

For instance, you can mirror your Android phone screen on the computer and the other way round. In this article, viewers will get to know how to mirror an Android screen on PC wirelessly or through a USB cable.</p><p>Screen Mirroring is quite useful in many ways.

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi.

One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.

This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> If you’re on a budget and in the market for a dashboard camera, the Apeman C450 is a worthy consideration. For under $50, it captures smooth, detailed video in full 1080p HD resolution. It’s easy to use (even though the user manual is substandard) and it won’t give you any problems during the drive. It does have a few points of frustration, but that shouldn’t be a shock at this price point—it’s hard to make a truly good dashcam for this cheap.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/wyf8r7L4gDINa5Etodv7VR7ogds=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_03-3a8b995526fe491b9634a885db40804a.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886003/19272" target="_top" id="1886003">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886003" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886003/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135404/19272" target="_top" id="2135404">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135404" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135404/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-All-the-basics"><a href="#Design-All-the-basics" class="headerlink" title="Design: All the basics"></a><strong>Design: All the basics</strong></h2><p> The Apeman C450 has a three-inch screen that’s bright, detailed, and provides an at-a-glance view of the camera’s status. If it were much bigger, it would be both a distraction and dangerous visual obstruction.</p><p> The camera comes with both a suction cup (which attaches to the windshield) and a dash mount, so there are two different options for setting it up in your car. Power supply options include a USB cord and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/finding-the-right-12v-usb-adapter-534755" >12V adapter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (the kind that plugs into your car’s cigarette lighter). The 12V adapter has a built in<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-a-usb-port-818166" >USB port <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is very convenient if you don’t have one in your car—it can not only power up the dashcam but also your smartphone or other device.</p><p> It scratches easily, parts fall off, and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it.</p><p> The controls on this dashboard camera are a bit counterintuitive. The fact that the navigation and “OK” buttons are on opposite sides means you must use two hands to navigate the menu. We found ourselves constantly hitting the menu button when we meant to hit “OK”, which was pretty frustrating and generally a poor design.</p><p> One big thing to note about this dashcam is that it’s not very durable. It scratches easily, parts fall off (more on that later), and you must treat it gently or risk damaging it. For example, we kept the protective plastic attached to the display during part of our testing, and when we removed it, the screen got a big scratch within the first minute, just from setting it down on a piece of wooden furniture.</p><p> This car camera stores video on a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/move-apps-to-sd-card-on-android-4178982" >MicroSD card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . There isn’t one included, so you’ll have to buy one. And while Apeman claims that the maximum size is 32GB, we tried out a 64GB card and it worked just fine—we filled it up to capacity and didn’t notice any problems with the device or the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/A63ztrIxThbZlrb_lHJH3YL7778=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_02-6ef4e204d0bd452b9601ec468e5358bf.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself"><a href="#Setup-Process-You’ll-have-to-figure-a-lot-of-stuff-out-for-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself"></a><strong>Setup Process: You’ll have to figure a lot of stuff out for yourself</strong></h2><p> The user manual included with the Apeman C450 isn’t particularly useful, and though its written in English, the language is full of confusing phrases that feel like poor translations. The features are not fully explained and there are key omissions in the instructions that make understanding and using this dashcam much harder.</p><p> The main thing to set up is the mount in your car. The Apeman C450 comes with both a suction cup and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-car-gps-trackers-4158961" >dash mount, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and fortunately it’s easy to attach both. The suction cup sticks firmly on your windshield via a simple locking knob, and once it’s attached, it’s not going anywhere. We had our test unit attached to a windshield for four days and it never failed.</p><p> One thing to note about the suction cup is that the bolt and pin that hold the hinge together come off very easily. During our testing, ours got away from us within the first few hours—the bolt fell off and the pin disappeared into the ether. We eventually found the bolt again, but the pin never reemerged.</p><p> Since there are no extra parts included in the box, the suction cup instantly became useless. After a failed trip to the hardware store, we just had to stick a cotter pin through the hole to keep the hinge attached. Consider this a warning: keep an eye on all the parts when you’re assembling this dashcam.</p><p> As an alternative, the mount can also be stuck to your dashboard with an adhesive strip. Just make sure you place it in the right spot the first time or you risk losing some of the stickiness. One benefit the dash mount has over the suction cup is that it doesn’t take up any real estate on your windshield that may obstruct your view of traffic.</p><p> Your first time using the Apeman C450, you also have the option to set up a time and date stamp as well as a car identification number on your videos. This is a nice option to keep track of when a video was recorded, and which car it was recorded from if you have more than one camera in different vehicles.</p><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Acceptable-for-a-budget-device" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Acceptable for a budget device</strong></h2><p> You can set this dashcam to capture video in 1080p, 720p, and VGA resolution. That’s impressive for a camera this size, and Apeman puts 1080p Full HD front and center in their marketing materials. While it provides a good level of detail and clarity in the video, it’s worth noting that other dashcams out there can record in resolutions up to 1440p.</p><p> The camera also has the ability to record audio, but it’s an internal mic and not very directional so it picks up everything. When we tested it, we heard a lot of engine and wind noise while driving. Voices came through alright, but it’s not a high-quality recording and didn’t pick up anything happening outside the vehicle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Hp7FvJ_BMgl0S2-Dsd-hd2qiQ7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/02LW4062264_04-82d0af63043344a6b7b44863790050d7.jpg"                      alt="Apeman C540 Dashcam"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Danny Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them"><a href="#Performance-Travels-as-well-as-the-rest-of-them" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them"></a><strong>Performance: Travels as well as the rest of them</strong></h2><p> During our testing, the Apeman C450 performed exactly as we expected. It never shut down unexpectedly, it stayed attached to the windshield, and it yielded no problems during the drive.</p><p> We reviewed the video on a high-definition screen and it was as clear as can be expected from a camera this size. When traveling at freeway speeds there was some motion blur and pixelation and we couldn’t make out small details like license plate numbers or read billboards clearly. However, when the car was on smaller streets and back roads, the details got much better.</p><p> When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten.</p><p> The Apeman C450 records video with a 170-degree FOV (field of view). This is great because it captures the whole view from your windshield, rather than just a portion of it. This wide angle produces a slight fish-eye effect, but it isn’t distracting and would be easy to fix with the right video editing software should you ever need to.</p><p> This dashcam also employs loop recording, meaning that it is constantly recording, but splits up the recording in one-, three- or five-minute chunks for review. The camera automatically overwrites older recordings when your memory card is full. You can also turn loop recording off if you want a full, uninterrupted video file of your drive.</p><p> Playback Mode allowed us to watch the videos we recorded, deleted unwanted ones, and lock any that we didn’t want to be overwritten. Playback Mode is functional as far as it goes, but if you want the best detail possible, you’ll have to watch your footage on a display bigger than three inches.</p><p> The C450 also comes equipped with a G-sensor that enables it to detect collisions. When it senses an impact on your vehicle, it automatically locks the video to make sure no critical footage is overwritten. This ensures you can prove who is at fault in a traffic incident to police or insurance companies. This dashcam also has a “Parking Guard” mode that behaves like a motion detection security camera for your car. However, this requires a special power supply since the battery won’t last long when not connected to power.</p><p> If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution.</p><p> One thing to note about this car dashboard camera is that the battery life is quite short. When we tested the Apeman C450, it powered down 28 minutes after we unplugged it. If you want continuous recording, it must be connected to power at all times.</p><h2 id="Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget"><a href="#Price-Affordable-even-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="Price: Affordable even on a budget"></a><strong>Price: Affordable even on a budget</strong></h2><p> The defects of this dashcam can be forgiven pretty easily considering that it costs less than $50. If you’re looking for a very inexpensive device, the Apeman C450 is a decent if somewhat flawed solution—it’s definitely not built as solidly and lacks the high resolution of its more expensive competitors, but if you are comfortable working around those shortcomings, this dashcam performs pretty well for the price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus"><a href="#Competition-Apeman-C450-vs-Z-Edge-Z3-Plus" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus"></a><strong>Competition: Apeman C450 vs. Z-Edge Z3 Plus</strong></h2><p> We tested the Apeman C450 side by side with the Z-Edge Z3 Plus dashcam. The Z3 Plus is considerably more expensive, and while we found these two devices to be generally similar in form and function, we ultimately favored the Z3 Plus because it lacks the small annoyances that made the Apeman C450 frustrating.</p><p> The interface and navigation controls on the Z3 Plus are smoother, it has higher resolution capacities, and we didn’t have a problem with components falling apart within a day of it arriving in the mail. It’s definitely pricier (usually $70 to $80 more expensive than the Apeman), but we think the improved quality of the camera and the better-looking video it produces make it a worthwhile upgrade for those who can afford it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/z-edge-z3-plus-review-4770582" >Z-Edge Z3 Plus Dashcam Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A decent budget dashcam with some flaws that are annoying but not necessarily deal-breaking.</strong></p><p> Despite a poor-quality build and some design quirks, the Apeman C450 does its job as a dashcam. It has a discreet design, captures pretty good-quality video, and has important extra features like collision detection and a surveillance mode. If you can get past some of its foibles, it’s definitely worth the price tag.</p><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ddpai-mini3-review-4770579" >DDpai mini3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/rexing-v1-dashcam-review-4770571" >Rexing V1 DashCam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/anker-roav-dashcam-c1-review-4773139" >Anker Roav DashCam C1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  C450 Dash Cam</li><li>Product Brand  Apeman</li><li>MPN  X0023JN4OL</li><li>Price  $39.99</li><li>Weight  12 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  5.3 x 4.2 x 3.8 in.</li><li>Camera  170-degree FOV, WDR</li><li>Recording Quality  1080p</li><li>Crash Detection  Yes</li><li>Parking Mode  Yes</li><li>Connectivity options  USB</li><li>Storage  Up to 32GB SDHC card (Class 10)</li><li>Warranty  12 months</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-discovering-dormant-dialogues-among-youtube-watchers/"><u>[New] Discovering Dormant Dialogues Among YouTube Watchers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-switch-windows-11-to-auto-hdr-mode/"><u>2024 Approved How to Switch Windows 11 To Auto HDR Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/best-3-itel-a60-emulator-for-mac-to-run-your-wanted-android-apps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Best 3 Itel A60 Emulator for Mac to Run Your Wanted Android Apps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/best-apple-iphone-8-and-ipad-screen-mirroring-app-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Best Apple iPhone 8 & iPad Screen Mirroring App | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/finessing-voices-in-instagrams-storytelling-and-videos-for-2024/"><u>Finessing Voices in Instagram's Storytelling and Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/hassle-free-ways-to-remove-frp-lock-from-oppo-a18-phones-withwithout-a-pc-by-drfone-android/"><u>Hassle-Free Ways to Remove FRP Lock from Oppo A18 Phones with/without a PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-i-use-itools-gpx-file-to-catch-the-rare-pokemon-on-samsung-galaxy-a25-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can I use iTools gpx file to catch the rare Pokemon On Samsung Galaxy A25 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-lava-blaze-2-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Change Location on Yik Yak For your Lava Blaze 2 to Enjoy More Fun | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-guide-to-mirror-your-sony-xperia-5-v-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Guide to Mirror Your Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-apple-iphone-6s-to-pc-via-usb-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror Apple iPhone 6s to PC via USB? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/quick-guide-terminating-your-apple-id-account-forever-with-these-five-strategies/"><u>Quick Guide: Terminating Your Apple ID Account Forever with These Five Strategies</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

I have a work-related assignment for which I want to mirror the PC screen to my Android phone. Still, there are so many means that it is causing a doubt which one is better than the rest.</p><p>Android platform is currently the most popular smartphone OS available on the market. The reason behind the deserved fame is the framework’s intuitiveness and accessibility. One of such utilities of Android is screen sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/mirror-pc-screen-to-android.jpg"                      alt="mirror pc screen to android "                ></p><p>In this article, we’ll be talking about the PC screen mirroring to Android and discuss what platforms offer better service than the rest.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Mirror-PC-Screen-to-Android-Can-I-Cast-Screen-from-Windows-to-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Mirror-PC-Screen-to-Android-Can-I-Cast-Screen-from-Windows-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Mirror PC Screen to Android - Can I Cast Screen from Windows to Android?</h2><p>Yes, you can mirror your computer’s screen to your Android phone. It means that you will be able to remotely access and manage the PC screen with an Android Screen. Such convenience is handy for developers, teachers, and pretty much every professional who has to deal with both PC and phone daily.</p><p>Screencasting or mirroring is also possible on a phone that isn’t rooted. However, there are a few things that you have to do from the phone’s settings menu to enable PC mirroring. It is called USB debugging. The method to debug the Android phone is as follows:</p><p>1. You would need to connect the Android phone to the computer via USB cable to initiate the procedure;</p><p>2. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;</p><p>3. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;</p><p>4. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;</p><p>5. You will see the Build Number of the Realme 12+ 5G device. Tap on the option 7 times. It will bring the Realme 12+ 5G device into developer mode;</p><p>6. Repeat Step 2!</p><p>7. Enable USB Debugging and tap on OK to grant permission.</p><p>Once you switch on the USB Debugging, the other thing you should remember is that the Android device and the PC need to be connected to the same WiFi network. Otherwise, the process of mirroring won’t work.</p><p>In the next section of the article, we will look into the top three apps to mirror PC screen to Android. We will discuss the pros and cons of all of them. It will assist you in finally choosing the most suitable app to use the Android device to mirror your PC’s screen.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Mirror-PC-Screen-to-Android-How-to-Choose-Apps-to-Mirror-PC-to-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Mirror-PC-Screen-to-Android-How-to-Choose-Apps-to-Mirror-PC-to-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The process is also known as screen sharing, and it requires a stable internet connection to enable.</p><p>These apps are available across not only Android but also on other top platforms such as macOS, iOS, Windows, and even Linux. Some apps are free to use, and some are subscription-based.</p><p>Here we will share relevant info regarding the top three platforms to mirror PC to Android.</p><h3 id="2-1-Chrome-Remote-Desktop"><a href="#2-1-Chrome-Remote-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Chrome Remote Desktop"></a>2.1 Chrome Remote Desktop</h3><p>The Chrome Remote Desktop service is a free-to-use PC to Android screen sharing service, enabled by Google. The platform is among the most popular remote control apps. It is not only easy to use but also secure. You can easily manage or access the content of the computer from the Android with Chrome Remote Desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/mirror-pc-screen-to-android-3.jpg"                      alt="mirror pc to android 3"                ></p><p>The pros and cons of the Chrome Remote Desktop service are as follows:</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It is free of charge.

When you collapse the virtual keyboard and try to use the mouse to click on things, the cursor is offset from what is shown on the screen. So you have to aim off by some degree to click on things you intend to click on. Rather annoying. Need to disconnect and reconnect every time to restore functionality.”</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-about-Android-Screen-Mirroring-App"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-about-Android-Screen-Mirroring-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs about Android Screen Mirroring App"></a>Part 3: FAQs about Android Screen Mirroring App</h2><ol><li><strong>Why do you need to use Screen Mirroring Apps for Android?</strong></li></ol><p>The reason for having a <strong>screen mirroring app for Android</strong> devices is to provide a quick and effective option for sharing screens with bigger devices.

With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme 12 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148650/16836" target="_top" id="2148650">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148650" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148650/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices. However, before you go on to install this app; we must notice that it is necessary for you to root your device. Alongside this, there is a short payment that must be made to enjoy all its features. Otherwise, it is a great app to have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airstream.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148640/16836" target="_top" id="2148640">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148640" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="234" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148640/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In the above section, we have listed out the best applications for you when you wish to use AirPlay with your Android device.

One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or a faulty sound card driver.</p><p> There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update your sound card driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your computer, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy</strong></a> .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact sound card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:</p><ol><li>Download and install<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy</strong></a> .</li><li>Run Driver Easy and click the<strong>Scan Now</strong> button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-09-20_11-48-18.png"                                     ></li><li>Click<strong>Update All</strong> to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.</li></ol><p> Alternatively if you’re comfortable manually installing drivers, you can click<strong>Update</strong> next to each flagged device in the free version to automatically download the correct driver. Once it’s downloaded, you can manually install it.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-09-20_11-49-09.png"                                     ></p><p> You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Realme 12 Pro 5G to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites. However, it is important for the users to note that they must be running Android 2.1 or later and also should have a working ZappoTV account setup if they are looking to use this app. Alongside, DLNA and UPnP connectivity is available through an internal purchase.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162549992.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Apple TV AirPlay Media Player"                ></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Twonky Beam:</strong> Here is the application that is ideal for streaming video apps. Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these. Sharing content between devices on the home network in the presence of an UPnP standard that is instrumental in helping users save media from their local network to the mobile device as the content is streamed on the Apple TV. However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Solutions-for-Receiving-Messages-Phone-Calls-While-Using-Do-Not-Disturb-Feature-on-Your-iPhone"><a href="#Solutions-for-Receiving-Messages-Phone-Calls-While-Using-Do-Not-Disturb-Feature-on-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Solutions for Receiving Messages &amp; Phone Calls While Using Do Not Disturb Feature on Your iPhone"></a>Solutions for Receiving Messages &amp; Phone Calls While Using Do Not Disturb Feature on Your iPhone</h2><p> Whether you want to focus on your task at hand or take a much-needed rest without disruptions, Do Not Disturb is a feature that helps you do just that. No story reply, group chat gossip, or work call will reach you as long as you have Do Not Disturb mode enabled on your iPhone.</p><p> However, if you’re still getting texts and calls on Do Not Disturb, it pretty much defeats the purpose of the feature. So, let’s look at the steps you can take when Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><h2 id="1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode"><a href="#1-Check-Whether-You-Enabled-the-Correct-Focus-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Whether You Enabled the Correct Focus Mode"></a>1. Check Whether You Enabled the Correct Focus Mode</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1-2.jpg"                      alt="do not disturb and personal mode in iphone control center"                ></p><p> Although Apple started with Do Not Disturb, the feature has since been expanded to Focus mode. Focus includes Do Not Disturb, Personal, Work, and so on. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/focus-mode-ideas-to-set-up-in-ios/" >set up different Focus modes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and customize them for different purposes.</p><p> If you accidentally enabled<strong>Work</strong> mode instead of<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> or<strong>Personal</strong> mode on your iPhone, you will certainly receive texts and calls from work colleagues because the latter wasn’t made to deter people from your workplace.</p><p> Therefore, before proceeding with the other suggestions in the list, access your iPhone’s<strong>Control Center</strong> and check that you have the correct Focus mode turned on to match your activity.</p><h2 id="2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps"><a href="#2-Review-Your-Allowed-Apps" class="headerlink" title="2. Review Your Allowed Apps"></a>2. Review Your Allowed Apps</h2><p> Do Not Disturb lets you choose which app you want to receive notifications from, even when it’s enabled. For example, when working, you naturally wouldn’t want to miss notifications from collaborative apps like Slack and Asana.</p><p> But if you feel that Do Not Disturb is not working as it should, and you’re left wondering why you’re still getting notifications from apps you don’t want to hear from, go to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Apps</strong> to review the apps with allowed notifications.</p><p> Then, tap the<strong>minus (-)</strong> button to remove an unwanted app from the list. This way, it won’t bypass your Do Not Disturb mode anymore.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/focus-modes.JPEG"                      alt="focus modes on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-apps.JPEG"                      alt="allowed apps on do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications"><a href="#3-Disable-Time-Sensitive-Notifications" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable Time-Sensitive Notifications"></a>3. Disable Time-Sensitive Notifications</h2><p> Examples of time-sensitive notifications are reminders, emails, or messages that contain references to date and time. So, for instance, even if the<strong>Messages</strong> app is not in your list of Allowed Apps, an iPhone text message may still pass through Do Not Disturb due to the nature of its content, thus making it seem that Do Not Disturb is not working on your iPhone.</p><p> If you don’t want to receive such notifications, go to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings in the<strong>Settings</strong> app. Tap<strong>Apps</strong> and toggle off<strong>Time-Sensitive Notifications</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/3-3.jpg"                      alt="disable time sensitive notifications for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Alternatively, you can tap<strong>Turn Off</strong> for a specific app if you see its notifications pop up on your Lock Screen.</p><h2 id="4-Change-Settings-for-Incoming-Calls"><a href="#4-Change-Settings-for-Incoming-Calls" class="headerlink" title="4. Change Settings for Incoming Calls"></a>4. Change Settings for Incoming Calls</h2><p> When you first enable Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone,<strong>Favorites</strong> tends to be the default setting for the incoming calls allowed. If you previously added quite a few family members and friends to your Favorites list, this may be why your iPhone calls are coming through even after you enabled Do Not Disturb, as if it’s not working.</p><p> To change this, head to<strong>Settings &gt; Focus &gt; Do Not Disturb</strong> <strong>&gt; People</strong> . Now, tap on<strong>Allow Calls From</strong> and select your preferred option. If you want to only allow specific individuals to call you during Do Not Disturb mode, choose<strong>Allowed People Only</strong> and tap the<strong>Add</strong> button above to select your contacts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/do-not-disturb-settings.JPEG"                      alt="do not disturb settings on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-favorite-calls.JPEG"                      alt="call settings for do not disturb mode on iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975821/19272" target="_top" id="1975821">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975821" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975821/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-allowed-calls.JPEG"                      alt="change calls allowed on iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062450/7443" target="_top" id="1062450">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062450" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062450/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls"><a href="#5-Don’t-Allow-Repeated-Calls" class="headerlink" title="5. Don’t Allow Repeated Calls"></a>5. Don’t Allow Repeated Calls</h2><p> If someone calls you more than once in a three-minute timespan, Do Not Disturb lets their call come through, regardless of the incoming call preferences you indicated earlier. This feature ensures that people can reach you in cases of emergencies, and it’s not because Do Not Disturb is not working.</p><p> But if there are people who call you mindlessly the moment you don’t pick up, and this feature ends up giving you more problems than convenience, you can choose to disable it. As outlined in the previous solution, go to the<strong>People</strong> settings in<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> . Then, toggle off<strong>Allow Repeated Calls</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2-2.jpg"                      alt="turn off allow repeated calls for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094476/7443" target="_top" id="2094476">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094476" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094476/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Turn-Off-or-Hide-Your-Focus-Status"><a href="#6-Turn-Off-or-Hide-Your-Focus-Status" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn Off or Hide Your Focus Status"></a>6. Turn Off or Hide Your Focus Status</h2><p> When you turn on Do Not Disturb, you can also share your Focus status to let your contacts know that you’re temporarily unavailable.</p><p> While it’s a thoughtful feature that helps you inform others, a downside is its accompanying Notify Anyway option, which lets people override your Do Not Disturb mode. This causes text messages and calls to come through your iPhone.</p><p> To stop receiving texts and calls in this manner, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-notify-anyway-focus-mode-iphone/" >turn off your Focus status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-hide-focus-status-from-certain-contacts-iphone/" >hide your Focus status from certain iPhone contacts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Review-Your-Do-Not-Disturb-Schedule"><a href="#7-Review-Your-Do-Not-Disturb-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="7. Review Your Do Not Disturb Schedule"></a>7. Review Your Do Not Disturb Schedule</h2><p> Let’s say you used to work morning shifts every day and had set your Do Not Disturb schedule to match. If you suddenly switch to afternoon shifts, you may feel that Do Not Disturb is not working because you’re receiving unwanted texts and calls on your iPhone during your new working hours.</p><p> However, it’s simply because of your old Do Not Disturb schedule, which automatically turns off in the evening, as per your original setting. So, if there’s a change in your routine, remember to check and adjust your Do Not Disturb schedule to fit accordingly.</p><p> Head to your<strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> settings and tap on your existing schedule to edit it. You can also tap<strong>Add Schedule</strong> to set a new time to turn on Do Not Disturb.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-schedule.JPEG"                      alt="schedule for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-schedule-2.JPEG"                      alt="automate schedule for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/dnd-change-schedule.JPEG"                      alt="set time for iphone do not disturb mode"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="8-Restart-Your-iPhone-and-Update-iOS"><a href="#8-Restart-Your-iPhone-and-Update-iOS" class="headerlink" title="8.

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Realme 12 Pro 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 Pro 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 Pro 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 Pro 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 Pro 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi.
