You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?"></a>Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?</h2><p>If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone XS Max devices through an Apple’s solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.</p><p>Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.</p><h3 id="What-You-Need"><a href="#What-You-Need" class="headerlink" title="What You Need?"></a>What You Need?</h3><ul><li>Your Mac should be updated to the macOS Catalina – with a Mac that is both compatible for Catalina and allows you to operate Sidecar.</li><li>iPad that runs over iPadOS 13 or above.</li><li>The iPad and Mac should be logged in under a similar iCloud account for a successful screen share.</li><li>A wireless connection requires you to stay within 10m of the premises of your Mac.</li></ul><h3 id="iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="iPads Compatible with Sidecar"></a>iPads Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>12.9-inch iPad Pro</li><li>11-inch iPad Pro</li><li>10.5-inch iPad Pro</li><li>9.7-inch iPad Pro</li><li>iPad (6th generation or later)</li><li>iPad mini (5th generation)</li><li>iPad Air (3rd generation)</li></ul><h3 id="Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="Macs Compatible with Sidecar"></a>Macs Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>MacBook Pro (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook Air (2018 or later)</li><li>iMac (2017 or later, as well as 27in iMac 5K, late 2015)</li><li>iMac Pro</li><li>Mac mini (2018 or later)</li><li>Mac Pro (2019)</li></ul><h3 id="Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina"><a href="#Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina" class="headerlink" title="Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina"></a>Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina</h3><p>With a compatible and working Mac and iPad, you can easily set up a screen mirroring environment across your devices by following the guidelines offered as follows.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPad</strong></p><p>You need to configure setting up your iPad either through a USB connection with the Mac or through a Bluetooth connection.

So, screen mirroring is neither sharing software nor media streaming nor does it involve the use of physical connectors such as HDMI or various other cables.</p><p>It is a wireless mirroring of data from a screen-sending device to a screen-receiving device. Users who have screens mirrored can access files, control mobile notifications, manage applications, take screenshots, stream movies, and more while controlling their iPhones. Some methods of screen mirroring can also enable reverse control.</p><p>Screen mirroring can work with the presence of a local Wi-Fi network, or without one – but a USB in that case is essential. Ideally, either device should be in the same room. The terminology of screen mirroring cannot be explained in simpler words. Therefore, we will next look at how screen mirroring works.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Screen-Mirroring-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Screen-Mirroring-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Besides, there are also a few screens mirroring protocols to follow, such as the presence of hardware or software receivers on the receiving devices.</p><p>An example of a hardware receiver is an Apple TV, Chromecast, and many others. A software receiver is a device that uses a software application like Reflector to turn an existing device into a screen-receiver – as applicable on Mac or Windows computers.</p><p>There are several ways to establish connections for screen mirroring. Devices that are not compatible with the mirroring wirelessly can create technological barriers for bigger settings. Fortunately, there are third-party solutions that can bridge the gap and enable compatible devices to mirror screens.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Stream-My-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Laptop"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Stream-My-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?"></a>Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?</h2><p>If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone XS Max devices through an Apple’s solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.</p><p>Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes.

Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to a computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Play-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-on-computer-using-built-in-AirPlay-option"><a href="#Part-1-Play-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-on-computer-using-built-in-AirPlay-option" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Play Apple iPhone XS Max video on computer using built-in AirPlay option"></a>Part 1: Play Apple iPhone XS Max video on computer using built-in AirPlay option</h2><p>As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone XS Max across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone XS Max onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone XS Max has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone XS Max to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-to-PC-with-VLC-Streamer"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-to-PC-with-VLC-Streamer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to PC with VLC Streamer"></a>Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to PC with VLC Streamer</h2><p>There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone XS Max videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around. VLC Streamer is a perfect platform that offers you to stream videos over an Apple iPhone XS Max through a PC. The process for executing this feature is quite simple and straightforward. To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download the VLC streamer across your Apple iPhone XS Max and PC simultaneously. Search through the App Store and download its free version across your Apple iPhone XS Max. Similarly, browse the platform on your PC and download the appropriate version that suits your PC. After downloading, you need to follow the on-screen guidelines to install it across your computer efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> File up the movies present in your devices, mobiles, or computer on the platform. This can be executed by double-clicking on the icon present on the desktop and launching the platform on your PC.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click “Add Movies” to open up the dialog box that would help you browse the movies present on your computer. Select and add the movies onto the VLC Streamer. The movies take a while to process into the platform and would show with a prompt message of “Complete” once they are successfully added.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/add-movies.jpg"                      alt="add movies"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Open the VLC Streamer application on the Apple iPhone XS Max and discover the visible computers present near it.

You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?"></a>Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?</h2><p>If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone XS Max devices through an Apple’s solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.</p><p>Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.</p><h3 id="What-You-Need"><a href="#What-You-Need" class="headerlink" title="What You Need?"></a>What You Need?</h3><ul><li>Your Mac should be updated to the macOS Catalina – with a Mac that is both compatible for Catalina and allows you to operate Sidecar.</li><li>iPad that runs over iPadOS 13 or above.</li><li>The iPad and Mac should be logged in under a similar iCloud account for a successful screen share.</li><li>A wireless connection requires you to stay within 10m of the premises of your Mac.</li></ul><h3 id="iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="iPads Compatible with Sidecar"></a>iPads Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>12.9-inch iPad Pro</li><li>11-inch iPad Pro</li><li>10.5-inch iPad Pro</li><li>9.7-inch iPad Pro</li><li>iPad (6th generation or later)</li><li>iPad mini (5th generation)</li><li>iPad Air (3rd generation)</li></ul><h3 id="Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="Macs Compatible with Sidecar"></a>Macs Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>MacBook Pro (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook Air (2018 or later)</li><li>iMac (2017 or later, as well as 27in iMac 5K, late 2015)</li><li>iMac Pro</li><li>Mac mini (2018 or later)</li><li>Mac Pro (2019)</li></ul><h3 id="Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina"><a href="#Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina" class="headerlink" title="Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina"></a>Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina</h3><p>With a compatible and working Mac and iPad, you can easily set up a screen mirroring environment across your devices by following the guidelines offered as follows.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPad</strong></p><p>You need to configure setting up your iPad either through a USB connection with the Mac or through a Bluetooth connection.

Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to a computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Play-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-on-computer-using-built-in-AirPlay-option"><a href="#Part-1-Play-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-on-computer-using-built-in-AirPlay-option" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Play Apple iPhone XS Max video on computer using built-in AirPlay option"></a>Part 1: Play Apple iPhone XS Max video on computer using built-in AirPlay option</h2><p>As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone XS Max across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone XS Max onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone XS Max has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Stream-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Computer"><a href="#How-to-Stream-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Stream Apple iPhone XS Max to Computer?"></a>How to Stream Apple iPhone XS Max to Computer?</h2><p>iPhones, a series of smartphones from US tech giant Apple, need no introduction. The chances are that you find it pretty uneasy to stream Apple iPhone XS Max to the computer to have a better view of your smartphone and other apps running on it. Still, doing that allows you to video-conference your screen and share it with someone on the other end. Well, the task you wish to accomplish is no rocket science.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-01.jpg"                      alt="stream iphone to computer 1"                ></p><p>The reason for this is that this informative tutorial will explain everything you need to know about it. Interestingly enough, you will learn multiple methods of achieving that. In the end, you will choose from a list of options. We assure you that you will find the steps easy-to-follow and will start enjoying the viewing experience in no time. Now, let’s get started.</p><h2 id="AirbeamTV-Only-Chrome-Browser"><a href="#AirbeamTV-Only-Chrome-Browser" class="headerlink" title="AirbeamTV (Only Chrome Browser)"></a>AirbeamTV (Only Chrome Browser)</h2><p>The first method you will learn is how to use AirbeamTV on your cellphone to stream from your Chrome browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-02.jpg"                      alt="stream iphone to computer 2"                ></p><p>You should follow the steps below to do that.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to download and install the app on your smartphone. To do that, go to your app store and search AirbeamTV. Once you locate the app, you will opt for the Mirroring to the Mac option. Download the app and install it. Afterward, go to your PC to download the Chrome browser if you don’t have one yet.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, return to your smartphone and go to Mirror Mac PC. The moment you open it, a code will pop up. Ensure that your laptop has the same network provider as Your Apple iPhone XS Max. Well, the reason is to get a seamless connection.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Return to your Chrome browser and type: Start.airbeam.tv. The moment you do that, the code on your mobile device appears on the browser. Then click on Connect. Once you look at your smartphone, you will see a notification telling you that you are connected to the Mac operating system.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on Start Mirroring and then Start Broadcast. At this point, your handheld device automatically connects to your browser. Everything that happens on your phone screen is shown in the Chrome browser. You can then share it with any video-conferencing tool of your choice. Similarly, you can display files, videos, and photos from your smartphone to your laptop.</p><h2 id="AirServer"><a href="#AirServer" class="headerlink" title="AirServer"></a>AirServer</h2><p>You can also connect your iOS devices to your laptop using AirServer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-03.jpg"                      alt="stream iphone to computer 3"                ></p><p>As always, ensure that laptops and iDevice use the same WiFi network. If you have iOS 11 or the newer version, you should follow these steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once your iDevice is connected to your laptop, head to the bottom of the screen to access the Control Center. You can access the Control Center on any iPhone by swiping down the top right corner of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect your Phone: Now, tap the Screen Mirroring icon on your handheld device. Once you do that, your network will begin to display the list of AirPlay-enabled receivers. That will become the name of the system that runs the Airserver. However, your smartphone should be able to support the service. That explains why you should opt for the iOS mentioned earlier. If you do not see the AirPlay icon, you have to troubleshoot your PC. At this juncture, you will see your phone screen displayed on your laptop.</p><p>Note that this works for iOS 8 and newer versions. Interestingly, you just need to follow the same steps to do it. Regardless of the iOS version, it is fast and easy.</p><h2 id="5kPlayer"><a href="#5kPlayer" class="headerlink" title="5kPlayer"></a>5kPlayer</h2><p>Having discussed other ways you can stream the iPhone screen to pc, 5kPlayer is yet another method. You see, 5KPlayer is a software system that accesses desktops to stream or cast the screen of your iDevice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-04.jpg"                      alt="stream iphone to computer 4"                ></p><p>To get started, you will need AirPlay with 5KPlayer with an iDevice that runs on iOS 13. Once you meet these requirements, you should take these steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch 5KPlayer on your computer and then click on the AirPlay icon to turn it on.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make your way to your Apple iPhone XS Max’s Control Center by swiping down on it.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At this point, you have to tap on the Screen&#x2F;AirPlay Mirroring. When the Apple iPhone XS Max device list pops up, you should choose your computer. At this juncture, you have accomplished your task because your phone screen will appear on your desktop. You can stream now!</p><p>In truth, to stream Apple iPhone XS Max to Windows 10 using 5KPlayer is simple and easy to follow. All you have to do is to follow the steps outlined above. Once you have completed the process, you can cast your video and image from your cellphone to your system. It is even more interesting than it works with iPads too.</p><h2 id="MirrorGo"><a href="#MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="MirrorGo"></a>MirrorGo</h2><p>Last but not least is the MirrorGo software.</p><h3 id="Wondershare-Dr-Fone"><a href="#Wondershare-Dr-Fone" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/ios-screen-mirror/"  title="Wondershare Dr.Fone">Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Mirror your Apple iPhone XS Max to a big-screen PC</p><ul><li>Compatible with the latest iOS version for mirroring.</li><li>Mirror and reverse control your Apple iPhone XS Max from a PC while working.</li><li>Take screenshots and save directly on the PC</li></ul><p><strong>4,800,622</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p>With the innovative screencasting solution, you can stream your smartphone to a computer. Just as the methods above, this method is easy. That said, follow the steps below to use it.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download MirrorGo on your computer. As always, ensure that your iDevice and computer are on the same WiFi network.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Download | PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/mirrorgo-ios-home.jpg"                      alt="MirrorGo iOS product home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Slide your handheld device downwards and select the MirrorGo option. You can find it under Screen Mirroring.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/connect-iphone-to-computer-via-airplay.jpg"                      alt="choose MirrorGo under screen mirroring choices"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At this point, you have completed the task. All you have to do is start mirroring and exploring the content of your cellphone on your desktop.</p><p>Once you have established the connection, you can also control your cellphone from the same computer. To do that, you need to get a mouse or use your trackpad. When you get to Step 3 above, activate your phone’s AssisiveTouch and pair it with your system’s Bluetooth. Now, that’s all there is to it!</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>From the onset, we promised to simplify the steps, and we did. The thing is, you can choose any of the four options outlined above to stream your iDevices to your desktop. Note that the AirbeamTV option does not necessarily have to be a Mac OS. Given that Chrome runs on all platforms, you can use both Windows and Mac systems. All you need to do is install the Chrome browser and start streaming your cellphone to your PC. In other words, you do not need cables to stream your Apple iPhone XS Max to your PC because this process is wireless.</p><p>Remember, it runs on a WiFi connection. Once you have done it, you can have a better view of your cellphone and share certain activities on Your Apple iPhone XS Max with everyone in the room. It can do it during your board meeting or at home. For instance, you may further project to a screen, allowing more people in the office to watch you, as you demonstrate stuff from Your Apple iPhone XS Max. This, in turn, improves workflow, culminates in improved collaboration, and less time-wasting. Now, it is time to return to the steps and give it a shot.</p><h2 id="How-to-Screen-Share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#How-to-Screen-Share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to Screen Share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max?"></a>How to Screen Share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max?</h2><p>You all might have heard of screen mirroring platforms providing the basic services of extrapolating the screen experience of a user from a smaller view to a larger view, such as, from an iPad screen to a Mac OS PC. You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?"></a>Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?</h2><p>If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone XS Max devices through an Apple’s solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.</p><p>Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.</p><h3 id="What-You-Need"><a href="#What-You-Need" class="headerlink" title="What You Need?"></a>What You Need?</h3><ul><li>Your Mac should be updated to the macOS Catalina – with a Mac that is both compatible for Catalina and allows you to operate Sidecar.</li><li>iPad that runs over iPadOS 13 or above.</li><li>The iPad and Mac should be logged in under a similar iCloud account for a successful screen share.</li><li>A wireless connection requires you to stay within 10m of the premises of your Mac.</li></ul><h3 id="iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="iPads Compatible with Sidecar"></a>iPads Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>12.9-inch iPad Pro</li><li>11-inch iPad Pro</li><li>10.5-inch iPad Pro</li><li>9.7-inch iPad Pro</li><li>iPad (6th generation or later)</li><li>iPad mini (5th generation)</li><li>iPad Air (3rd generation)</li></ul><h3 id="Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="Macs Compatible with Sidecar"></a>Macs Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>MacBook Pro (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook Air (2018 or later)</li><li>iMac (2017 or later, as well as 27in iMac 5K, late 2015)</li><li>iMac Pro</li><li>Mac mini (2018 or later)</li><li>Mac Pro (2019)</li></ul><h3 id="Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina"><a href="#Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina" class="headerlink" title="Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina"></a>Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina</h3><p>With a compatible and working Mac and iPad, you can easily set up a screen mirroring environment across your devices by following the guidelines offered as follows.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPad</strong></p><p>You need to configure setting up your iPad either through a USB connection with the Mac or through a Bluetooth connection. It is preferable to set up a wired connection for better and efficient, lag-less results.</p><p><strong>Step 2: AirPlay Options</strong></p><p>Approach your Mac and tap on the “AirPlay” icon present on the top of the menu bar. It can be observed across the top-right of your Mac’s screen.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Connect with iPad</strong></p><p>With the iPad listed in the options, simply tap on it to extend your Mac’s screen onto the iPad with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/01/screen-share-mac-to-ipad-1.jpg"                      alt="select your ipad device"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Change Screen Options</strong></p><p>If you are up for mirroring the screen of your Mac onto the iPad, you need to slightly amend the settings available. Tap on the “Screen” icon that is being displayed across the status bar after a successful connection. Change the settings from “Use as Separate Display” to “Mirror Built-in Retina Display.” A similar procedure can also be executed through accessing the “Sidecar” section from the “System Preferences” of your Mac.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/01/screen-share-mac-to-ipad-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on mirror built in retina display option"                ></p><h3 id="More-Features-Offered-at-Sidecar"><a href="#More-Features-Offered-at-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="More Features Offered at Sidecar"></a>More Features Offered at Sidecar</h3><p>Sidecar has not been introduced as a simple screen mirroring system that helps you extend your workspace or seek ease in executing a task. It provides a series of other features that typically include a virtual “Touch Bar” that is present on the iPad for managing the Mac screen through the iPad with the features offered by the specific bar. As there is an exception of no-touch input with Sidecar, the use of an Apple Pencil can help you cover this task with ease, making your iPad act as a graphic tablet. The list of iPads below can provide such a feature of Sidecar to act as a graphic tablet.</p><ul><li>12.9in iPad Pro</li><li>11in iPad Pro</li><li>10.5in iPad Pro</li><li>9.7in iPad Pro</li></ul><h3 id="How-to-use-iPad-in-Screen-Mirroring-across-Older-Macs"><a href="#How-to-use-iPad-in-Screen-Mirroring-across-Older-Macs" class="headerlink" title="How to use iPad in Screen Mirroring across Older Macs"></a>How to use iPad in Screen Mirroring across Older Macs</h3><p>Although macOS Catalina brought tranquility in using the screen mirroring feature across your Apple devices, there are a few platforms that can still come quite handy in managing screen mirroring across the older Macs. The use of third-party tools can guide you in managing your Mac across the iPad, which still requires you to cover a few things before moving towards the connection.</p><h3 id="What-you-Need"><a href="#What-you-Need" class="headerlink" title="What you Need?"></a>What you Need?</h3><ul><li>Lightning to USB Cable.</li><li>iPad and a Mac is having a macOS 10.13.3 or earlier.</li><li>You should be having software such as Duet Display, iDisplay, or AirDisplay.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-third-party-software"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-third-party-software" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-screen-share-Mac-to-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-with-Apple’s-solution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?"></a>Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone XS Max with Apple’s solution?</h2><p>If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone XS Max devices through an Apple’s solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.</p><p>Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.</p><h3 id="What-You-Need"><a href="#What-You-Need" class="headerlink" title="What You Need?"></a>What You Need?</h3><ul><li>Your Mac should be updated to the macOS Catalina – with a Mac that is both compatible for Catalina and allows you to operate Sidecar.</li><li>iPad that runs over iPadOS 13 or above.</li><li>The iPad and Mac should be logged in under a similar iCloud account for a successful screen share.</li><li>A wireless connection requires you to stay within 10m of the premises of your Mac.</li></ul><h3 id="iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#iPads-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="iPads Compatible with Sidecar"></a>iPads Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>12.9-inch iPad Pro</li><li>11-inch iPad Pro</li><li>10.5-inch iPad Pro</li><li>9.7-inch iPad Pro</li><li>iPad (6th generation or later)</li><li>iPad mini (5th generation)</li><li>iPad Air (3rd generation)</li></ul><h3 id="Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar"><a href="#Macs-Compatible-with-Sidecar" class="headerlink" title="Macs Compatible with Sidecar"></a>Macs Compatible with Sidecar</h3><ul><li>MacBook Pro (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook (2016 or later)</li><li>MacBook Air (2018 or later)</li><li>iMac (2017 or later, as well as 27in iMac 5K, late 2015)</li><li>iMac Pro</li><li>Mac mini (2018 or later)</li><li>Mac Pro (2019)</li></ul><h3 id="Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina"><a href="#Using-iPad-as-the-second-screen-over-macOS-Catalina" class="headerlink" title="Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina"></a>Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina</h3><p>With a compatible and working Mac and iPad, you can easily set up a screen mirroring environment across your devices by following the guidelines offered as follows.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPad</strong></p><p>You need to configure setting up your iPad either through a USB connection with the Mac or through a Bluetooth connection.

Screen mirroring has been considered a very important and professional feature that helps you save a lot of fuss while sharing content with your colleagues or family. If you wish to show an important article or a video during an office presentation that would change the dynamics of the discussion, Apple presents its screen mirroring features operated through third-party screen mirroring applications that would allow you to share the small screen onto a larger screen. This prevents the members from standing up from their positions and look over the tiny screens by disturbing the discipline of the room. This article describes different mechanisms that allow you to execute screen mirroring on Apple iPhone XS Max successfully. These mechanisms present remedies to Apple iPhone XS Max users for connecting their phone with the computer and other big screens.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-on-iPhone-X"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-on-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring on iPhone X?"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring on iPhone X?</h2><p>Before understanding the procedures of how we can execute the screen mirroring on iPhone X, it is significant for us to understand what Apple iPhone XS Max really believes screen mirroring to be.

Since the complete procedure can be covered in a couple of steps, there are two different approaches that can be adapted to enable screen mirroring on iPhone X. You can either connect your phone to the larger device through hard-wired connection or associate through a wireless connection. However, these connections are not executed directly but require different third-party platforms for detecting the phone onto the Apple iPhone XS Max device. This article shall develop its focus on guiding you on how to attach your Apple iPhone XS Max onto different devices such as computers, TVs, and laptops.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Screen-Mirroring-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Samsung-TV"><a href="#Part-2-Screen-Mirroring-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-to-Samsung-TV" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Screen Mirroring Apple iPhone XS Max to Samsung TV"></a>Part 2: Screen Mirroring Apple iPhone XS Max to Samsung TV</h2><p>This part focuses on developing an understanding of iPhone users for connecting their phones onto Samsung TV through two different approaches.

Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to a computer.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Play-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-on-computer-using-built-in-AirPlay-option"><a href="#Part-1-Play-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-on-computer-using-built-in-AirPlay-option" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Play Apple iPhone XS Max video on computer using built-in AirPlay option"></a>Part 1: Play Apple iPhone XS Max video on computer using built-in AirPlay option</h2><p>As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone XS Max across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone XS Max onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone XS Max has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone XS Max to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-to-PC-with-VLC-Streamer"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-video-to-PC-with-VLC-Streamer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to PC with VLC Streamer"></a>Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone XS Max video to PC with VLC Streamer</h2><p>There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone XS Max videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around.
