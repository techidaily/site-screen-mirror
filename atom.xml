Like any new title, you can expect that it comes with bugs and glitches. Many players are actually reporting<strong>severe lags and connection issues</strong> while playing Forza Horizon 5. If you’re in the same boat, no worries! We’ve prepared a few working fixes for you to try.</p><h2 id="Try-these-fixes…"><a href="#Try-these-fixes…" class="headerlink" title="Try these fixes…"></a>Try these fixes…</h2><p> You don’t have to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >1: Shut down bandwidth-hogging programs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >2: Test your internet connection <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >3: Update your network driver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >4: Allow Forza Horizon 5 through the firewall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >5: Set the game process priority to high <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >6: Configure your DNS settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >7: Lower in-game settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Before we dive into anything advanced, make sure you check the server status first by checking the<a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/forza%5Fsupport" >Forza Support Twitter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If everything seems fine on the server end, you can proceed to the troubleshooting steps on your end.</p><h2 id="Fix-1-Shut-down-bandwidth-hogging-programs"><a href="#Fix-1-Shut-down-bandwidth-hogging-programs" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Shut down bandwidth-hogging programs"></a>Fix 1: Shut down bandwidth-hogging programs</h2><p> The first thing you can do is to make sure you’re not loading videos or running bandwidth-hogging programs in the background. You can check the bandwidth usage via Task Manager, and shut down the programs that seem to hog your network and slow down your game. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Right-click your taskbar, then click <strong>Task Manager</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg"                                     ></li><li>In the <strong>Network</strong>  column, select the bandwidth-hogging program(s), then click <strong>End Task</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/close-bandwidth-hogging-program.jpg"                                     ></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948949/19272" target="_top" id="1948949">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948949" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948949/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Hopefully the lagging issue doesn’t return after you close the bandwidth-hogging programs. If that’s the case, we’d suggest you play FH5 with the least programs running in the background according to your internet service capacity. Or, consult your internet service provider and consider upgrading your plan.</p><p>If the lagging issue persists, try the next fix.</p><h2 id="Fix-2-Test-your-internet-connection"><a href="#Fix-2-Test-your-internet-connection" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Test your internet connection"></a>Fix 2: Test your internet connection</h2><p> Lagging issues are network-related, so we should also test the internet connection to see if it needs a refresh. Here are a few basic troubleshooting steps you can try:</p><ul><li>Try to <strong>power cycle your router and modem</strong> . Unplug the power cables from your router and your modem, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then plug the cables back into both devices. When your Internet is working again, run Forza Horizon 5 to see if the game still lags.</li><li>If you’re playing on Wi-Fi, you don’t want other devices sharing the same network to cause overcrowding. You can try <strong>turning off the Wi-Fi feature on the devices you don’t use at the moment, or disconnect them from the Wi-Fi temporarily</strong> .</li><li>If possible, <strong>play on</strong> <strong>an ethernet connection</strong> . It’ll provide a more stable and reliable connection.</li><li>If your internet is slow, it could lead to an unstable connection. You can google “Internet speed test” and pick a tool to <strong>test your Internet speed</strong> . However, when your Internet connection is unreasonably slow, consider contacting your Internet provider for help.</li></ul><p> If your internet connection is just fine and you still encounter lags while playing Forza Horizon 5, try the next fix.</p><h2 id="Fix-3-Update-your-network-driver"><a href="#Fix-3-Update-your-network-driver" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Update your network driver"></a>Fix 3: Update your network driver</h2><p> In-game lags may indicate a driver issue. If your network adapter driver is outdated or faulty, it could cause random connection issues and thus trigger the lagging issue in Forza Horizon 5. You may want to make sure your network driver is up-to-date and functioning properly.</p><p> There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter: manually or automatically.</p><p><strong>Manual driver update</strong> – You can update the network adapter driver<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" > <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >via Device Manager <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . If Windows fails to detect the latest available update, you can search on the manufacturer sites. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your Windows version.</p><p><strong>Automatic driver update</strong> – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter and your Windows version, then it will download and install the driver correctly:</p><ol><li><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install Driver Easy.</p></li><li><p>Run Driver Easy and click the <strong>Scan Now</strong> button.

In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also <a class="link"   href="https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html" >download music from Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and enjoy it everywhere as you want.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162165513.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allstream"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Apple TV AirPlay Media Player:</strong> For the ones who have been following this list for a while, the name should be a getaway. However, the application is specifically designed to be used with Apple TV. The beauty of this app lies in its functionality which allows it to stream content based on the Android operating system and also any content that is stored on the local network to your Apple TV. It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control. This enables the users to browse, search, and share content from a variety of online sources which include video podcasts, YouTube, Facebook and other media based social media networking websites. However, it is important for the users to note that they must be running Android 2.1 or later and also should have a working ZappoTV account setup if they are looking to use this app. Alongside, DLNA and UPnP connectivity is available through an internal purchase.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162549992.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Apple TV AirPlay Media Player"                ></p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Twonky Beam:</strong> Here is the application that is ideal for streaming video apps. Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these. Sharing content between devices on the home network in the presence of an UPnP standard that is instrumental in helping users save media from their local network to the mobile device as the content is streamed on the Apple TV. However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162742182.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Twonky Beam"                ></p><p>Thus, we have compiled a list of a few applications that can come in handy if you are looking to enjoy the functionality of your content on the Apple TV. Android users earlier used to complain about not having anything on the Apple TV for their device, but with these apps and many others that can one discover on the Google play store, things have got better. Let us know in the comment section, how was your experience of streaming content from your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><h2 id="Top-10-AirPlay-Apps-in-Poco-M6-5G-for-Streaming"><a href="#Top-10-AirPlay-Apps-in-Poco-M6-5G-for-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Poco M6 5G for Streaming"></a>Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Poco M6 5G for Streaming</h2><p>AirPlay has changed the way people stream their music and other media content over several devices over a common wireless network. With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.</p><p>Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.</p><h3 id="1-Double-Twist"><a href="#1-Double-Twist" class="headerlink" title="1) Double Twist"></a>1) Double Twist</h3><p>We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/double-twist-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="2-iMediaShare-Lite"><a href="#2-iMediaShare-Lite" class="headerlink" title="2) iMediaShare Lite"></a>2) iMediaShare Lite</h3><p>This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="3-Twonky-Beam"><a href="#3-Twonky-Beam" class="headerlink" title="3) Twonky Beam"></a>3) Twonky Beam</h3><p>Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657400/16446" target="_top" id="1657400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657400/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-AllShare"><a href="#4-AllShare" class="headerlink" title="4) AllShare"></a>4) AllShare</h3><p>For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn’t come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Poco M6 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/supportOwnersHowToGuidePopup.do?howto_guide_seq=7761" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144597609.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble"><a href="#5-Android-HiFi-and-AirBubble" class="headerlink" title="5) Android HiFi and AirBubble"></a>5) Android HiFi and AirBubble</h3><p>There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="6-Zappo-TV"><a href="#6-Zappo-TV" class="headerlink" title="6) Zappo TV"></a>6) Zappo TV</h3><p>One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won’t recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player"><a href="#7-AirPlay-and-DLNA-Player" class="headerlink" title="7) AirPlay and DLNA Player"></a>7) AirPlay and DLNA Player</h3><p>This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="8-Using-Allcast"><a href="#8-Using-Allcast" class="headerlink" title="8) Using Allcast"></a>8) Using Allcast</h3><p>For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn’t allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/allcast.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><h3 id="9-Using-the-DS-Video"><a href="#9-Using-the-DS-Video" class="headerlink" title="9) Using the DS Video"></a>9) Using the DS Video</h3><p>One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.</p><p>Download it <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.synology.dsvideo" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/ds-video.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943750/22993" target="_top" id="1943750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943750/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959707/19272" target="_top" id="1959707">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959707" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959707/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-AirStream"><a href="#10-AirStream" class="headerlink" title="10) AirStream"></a>10) AirStream</h3><p>Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices. However, before you go on to install this app; we must notice that it is necessary for you to root your device. Alongside this, there is a short payment that must be made to enjoy all its features. Otherwise, it is a great app to have.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airstream.jpg"                      alt="top AirPlay apps in Android"                ></p><p>In the above section, we have listed out the best applications for you when you wish to use AirPlay with your Android device.

You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly.</td><td>You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G devices, saving you extra costs.</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938677/19272" target="_top" id="1938677">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938677" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938677/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>This article has provided an overview of the best methods available to <strong>mirror Realme 12 Pro+ 5G to Mac</strong> properly.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Cast-Realme-12-5G-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi"><a href="#How-to-Cast-Realme-12-5G-Screen-to-PC-Using-WiFi" class="headerlink" title="How to Cast Realme 12 5G Screen to PC Using WiFi"></a>How to Cast Realme 12 5G Screen to PC Using WiFi</h2><p>Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let’s discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Screen-Mirroring-Android-and-Casting" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting"></a>Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting</h2><p>Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.</p><p>So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Realme 12 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.</p><p>There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Realme 12 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.</p><p>However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Realme 12 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.</p><p>Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.</p><p>In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let’s try all of the options and choose one best!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/08/how-to-cast-android-screen-to-pc-using-wifi-1.jpg"                      alt="screen mirroring android and casting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast"><a href="#Part-2-Casting-Android-Screen-to-PC-with-ChromeCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast"></a>Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast</h2><p>For using this method, you will be required to create a personal Wi-Fi Hotspot. Here you can follow this method in the following way:</p><p><strong>For Computer</strong>:</p><ul><li>Go to the ‘Search’ Bar.</li><li>Type ‘Connect’.</li><li>Open ‘Connect App.</li></ul><p>Here you will find suitable options for hotspot connection.</p><p><strong>For Android (Version 5,6, 7)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Go to ‘Settings’.</li><li>Choose ‘Display’.</li><li>Select ‘Cast’.</li><li>Then click on the three dots to view ‘Menu’.</li><li>Then choose the ‘Enable Wireless Display’ option.</li></ul><p><strong>For Android (Version 8)</strong>:</p><ul><li>Go to ‘Settings’.</li><li>Choose ‘Connected Devices’.</li><li>Select ‘Cast’.</li><li>Then click on the three dots to view ‘Menu’.</li><li>Then choose the ‘Enable Wireless Display’ option.</li></ul><p>Now you have to wait until and unless the Realme 12 5G device is found.

However, what if one wishes to run AirPlay on their Android Device? While the amateur answer might be something different, we here are going to help you streaming anything from Poco X6 Pro to your Apple TV. This shall be done with the assistance of a few 3rd-party software applications. Streaming your media files and other content to the Apple TV from your Android Device is not as tricky as it sounds. Also, users do have the option to choose from numerous applications, and not just one. In the following section, we have discussed few of these applications.</p><p>Here are the apps you can use.</p><ol><li><strong>Double Twist:</strong> For the past few months, this application has become a favorite amongst android users who are looking to stream content through AirPlay. Also termed as a ‘triple threat’, this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one’s iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That’s not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads. The beauty of Double Twist lies in the fact that it can stream to any device that is compatible with the AirPlay standard and is connected to the same WiFi network.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542161702587.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Double Twist"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Allcast:</strong> The number two application on this list is ‘Allcast’ which allows the content from your mobile device to be streamed across set top boxes and dongles. The application is easily compatible with Apple TV and other devices enabled with AirPlay. One can communicate with Chromecast as this application offers support for DLNA along with communication for Amazon Fire TV, Xbox 360, and One, along with numerous other devices. So, one can make out that is one packs a solid punch. Not only this, as Allcast can also stream content from Google Drive and Dropbox account, along with any other storage device. However, if one is really eager to enjoy all the features offered by this application, like Double Twist, they have to loosen up $5. As reviewers, we thought it was totally worth it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg"                      alt="stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Allstream:</strong> For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers. Offering the functionality of both AirPlay and DLNA connectivity to its users, the temporarily free application acts as a transmitter. This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3.
