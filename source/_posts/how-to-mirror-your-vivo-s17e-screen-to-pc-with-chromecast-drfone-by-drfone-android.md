## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media.

## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror Vivo S17e to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror Vivo S17e to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| **Cons of Using USB Connection** | **Pros of Using Wireless Connection** |
| --- | --- |
| The wire that you might be used to establish the USB connection would be damaged, which is causing issues in attaching the Vivo S17e devices. | There are no threats of damaging any wire, which will disrupt the connection. |
| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Vivo S17e device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Vivo S17e device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Vivo S17e devices, saving you extra costs. |
