Mirroring Android Devices has been made easier with a very definitive and expansive device of AllCast where you can share your Xiaomi Redmi A2+screen to PC by following a few steps, as stated below.

**Step 1: Download Applications on both devices**

You need to have the AllCast application on both your PC and Xiaomi Redmi A2+phones for connecting them, and mirrors share your screen to the PC.

**Step 2: Open Computer Receiver**

After ensuring that the PC, as well as the mobile phone, are connected over the same Wi-Fi device, you need to initiate the process by opening the AllCast Receiver through the Chrome Application Launcher.

**Step 3: Initiate Mirror Share**

After getting the appropriate settings on the computer, you need to propagate towards the phone. Initiate ‘Screen Recording and Mirror’ on the Xiaomi Redmi A2+.

**Step 4: Synchronize Devices**

In the options presented by "Screen Recording and Mirror," you need to access the "Network Devices" and select the appropriate desktop model. Selecting the model will start screen sharing with 'Chrome @' followed by the IP Address of the computer. This allows you to mirror your Xiaomi Redmi A2+screen to PC wirelessly through AllCast without difficulty.
