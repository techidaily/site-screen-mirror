And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also [download music from Spotify](https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html) and enjoy it everywhere as you want.

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing.

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Motorola G54 5G  devices that allows you to **screen share on Motorola G54 5G ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
