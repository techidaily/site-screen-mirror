## 1.Why People Want to Mirror Their Android to PC?

The best thing about Android phones these days is that they are like mini computers in which you can save lots of things like photographs, videos, music, and even your important documents. Carrying a phone is very convenient as well, and you have the whole world gathered into a single device. But there are times when you need to show something important to other people on your phone and you need to connect it to your PC, especially if it is some important information which you collected from the internet, and want to show your family or colleagues. In situations like this mirroring, your Android to PC becomes really important as you don't have to mail or send the data to everyone.
