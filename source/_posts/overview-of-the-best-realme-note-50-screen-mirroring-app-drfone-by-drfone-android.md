Lowering it would defeat my purpose."

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Realme Note 50  Phone to  Realme TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Realme Note 50  devices that allows you to **screen share on Realme Note 50 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Realme Note 50  device to your  Realme TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Realme Note 50  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.
