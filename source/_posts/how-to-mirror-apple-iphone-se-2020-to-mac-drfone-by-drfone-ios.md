People use Apple iPhone SE (2020) emulators to test websites and also for checking various Apple iPhone SE (2020) applications as well.

Here are some online Apple iPhone SE (2020) emulators which can test how the website will look like if it is made to run on an iPhone. It is great to test and redesign even if you do not have an Apple iPhone SE (2020) at your disposal.
