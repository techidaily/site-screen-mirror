| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Vivo S17 Pro device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Vivo S17 Pro device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |

Users are requested to download the latest version of MirrorGo from their official website. Once installed, launch the application on the computer.

**Step 2: Same Internet Connection**

The user needs to ensure that the PC and Android device are connected across the same Wi-Fi connection. Once done, tap on the option of “Mirror Vivo S17 Pro PC via Wi-Fi” on the lower bottom of the application’s interface.

**Step 3: Attach through USB over Unsuccessful Connection**

If the user fails to mirror the Vivo S17 Pro device directly through Wi-Fi, they can connect their Android device with the PC via USB. Before that, it is important to turn on USB Debugging across the Android device for successful connection. Once the phone appears under "Select a device to connect," you can remove the Android phone from the USB connection.
