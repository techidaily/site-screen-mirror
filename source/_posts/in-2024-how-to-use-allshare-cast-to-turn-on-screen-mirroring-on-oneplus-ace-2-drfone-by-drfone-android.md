| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the OnePlus Ace 2 device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the OnePlus Ace 2 devices, saving you extra costs. |
