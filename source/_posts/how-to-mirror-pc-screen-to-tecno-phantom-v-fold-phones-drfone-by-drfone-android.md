## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

Download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waxrain.airplayer&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53YXhyYWluLmFpcnBsYXllciJd)

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

### 9) Using the DS Video

One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.

### 10) AirStream

Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices. However, before you go on to install this app; we must notice that it is necessary for you to root your device. Alongside this, there is a short payment that must be made to enjoy all its features. Otherwise, it is a great app to have.
