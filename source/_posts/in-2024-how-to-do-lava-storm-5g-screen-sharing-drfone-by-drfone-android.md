## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Lava Storm 5G  Phone to  Lava TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Lava Storm 5G  devices that allows you to **screen share on Lava Storm 5G ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
