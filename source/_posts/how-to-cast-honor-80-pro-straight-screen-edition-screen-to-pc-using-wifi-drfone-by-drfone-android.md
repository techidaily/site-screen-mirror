## How to Cast Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition Screen to PC Using WiFi

Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let's discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.


## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.
