## How to Screen Share Mac to Apple iPhone 6 Plus?

You all might have heard of screen mirroring platforms providing the basic services of extrapolating the screen experience of a user from a smaller view to a larger view, such as, from an iPad screen to a Mac OS PC. You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

## Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 6 Plus with Apple's solution?

If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices through an Apple's solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.

Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.

**Step 2: AirPlay Options**

Approach your Mac and tap on the “AirPlay” icon present on the top of the menu bar. It can be observed across the top-right of your Mac’s screen.

**Step 4: Change Screen Options**

If you are up for mirroring the screen of your Mac onto the iPad, you need to slightly amend the settings available. Tap on the "Screen" icon that is being displayed across the status bar after a successful connection. Change the settings from "Use as Separate Display" to "Mirror Built-in Retina Display." A similar procedure can also be executed through accessing the "Sidecar" section from the "System Preferences" of your Mac.

## Method 3: Share Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Screen Over FaceTime (SharePlay)

FaceTime can be another great technique to consider screen sharing Apple iPhone with other people. If you wish to show something important to some people, you can dial them through FaceTime and share the important thing in no time. FaceTime has recently adopted the SharePlay technology to give a wholesome experience in screen sharing.

Users with iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, or later can initiate a FaceTime call with the Music or Apple TV app for sharing music or video content, respectively. Where the applications can change, the process remains the same. FaceTime is quite diverse in functionality, which involves sharing the iPhone's screen.

### What Are the Requirements?

- iPhones and iPads running on iOS/iPadOS 15.4 and above allows users to start the FaceTime call through the Apple TV app (+ other supported streaming apps) and Music app (+ other music app alternatives). Then, they can use SharePlay for video/music sharing via the call with other participants.
- To screen share Apple iPhone 6 Plus to iPhone via FaceTime, the person sharing the content and the recipient should both have iOS 15.1+ (iPhones), macOS 12.1+ (Mac), or iPadOS 15.1+ (iPads).
- Users need Apple ID to access FaceTime.

With all these provisions in mind, you must follow the steps explained below to share your Apple iPhone 6 Plus screen over FaceTime with ease:

**Step 1:** You must start a FaceTime call and connect with your respective personnel. As you connect successfully, select the "Share Content" button on the top of the screen to start screen sharing.

**Step 3:** To end the screen sharing, you will have to tap on the "Share Content" button again to disconnect screen sharing.

## Method 4: Share Your Apple iPhone 6 Plus Screen to a Mac or Windows PC Using a Third-Party App
