## Part 1: Cast Your Apple iPhone 15 to Mac via AirPlay \[Best Choice\]

AirPlay is the dedicated technique available to cast the iPhone onto a Mac. While this is the direct option Apple provides for its devices, it is pretty simple to cover. You need to process a few basic steps to **cast to MacBook** with the help of this functionality. However, there are multiple drawbacks to using AirPlay in casting devices, which shall be discussed later.

Before that, let's look into how you can cast your Apple iPhone 15 to Mac using AirPlay:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, you will have to connect the iPhone and the Mac to the same Wi-Fi network. Afterward, access the "Control Center" of your Apple iPhone 15.
