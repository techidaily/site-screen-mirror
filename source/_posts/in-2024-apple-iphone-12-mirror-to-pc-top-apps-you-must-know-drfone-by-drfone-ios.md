## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 12 video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 12 across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 12 onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 12 has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 12 to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.

## Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone 12 video to PC with VLC Streamer

There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone 12 videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around. VLC Streamer is a perfect platform that offers you to stream videos over an Apple iPhone 12 through a PC. The process for executing this feature is quite simple and straightforward. To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.

**Step 1:** You need to download the VLC streamer across your Apple iPhone 12 and PC simultaneously. Search through the App Store and download its free version across your Apple iPhone 12. Similarly, browse the platform on your PC and download the appropriate version that suits your PC. After downloading, you need to follow the on-screen guidelines to install it across your computer efficiently.

**Step 2:** File up the movies present in your devices, mobiles, or computer on the platform. This can be executed by double-clicking on the icon present on the desktop and launching the platform on your PC.

**Step 3:** Click “Add Movies” to open up the dialog box that would help you browse the movies present on your computer. Select and add the movies onto the VLC Streamer. The movies take a while to process into the platform and would show with a prompt message of “Complete” once they are successfully added.
