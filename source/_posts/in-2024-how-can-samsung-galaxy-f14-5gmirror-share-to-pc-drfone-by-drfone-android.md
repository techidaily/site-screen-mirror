## Part 5: How to Mirror Phone to Computer with Dr.Fone Air

While you have looked into some great solutions **to cast your phone to a PC,** there is another tool that provides a similar experience in mirroring the screen of your phone onto a computer screen. [Wondershare Dr.Fone Air](https://drfoneair.wondershare.com/) is a great online tool designed for mirroring the phone's screen onto the computer for free. While it is a quick solution to work with, Wondershare Dr.Fone Air features some great functionalities which make it a unique tool:

- You can easily adjust the mirrored screen by zooming in and out, taking screenshots, and rotating it.
- You are not required to use Bluetooth and NFC for connecting devices in the process.
- It is a simple and quick process to screen mirror devices onto another screen.

### Screen Casting vs. Screen Mirroring: What's the Difference?

You might have heard of screencasting and screen mirroring together many times. It may come as a surprise to you that these two terminologies hold considerable differences from each other. To simplify the difference, screencasting is performed with the motive of displaying the content of the screen on another output display in the same room.

For screen mirroring, you display the content of the screen on another display while showing all the movements of the screen. Screen mirroring gives you the leverage to use the smartphone without any interruption.
