## How Honor X7b Mirror Screen to PC?

Mirror Screening has been devised as one of the most exquisite and simplest features in sharing data that provides you with the ability to share your smaller screens onto larger ones for people to observe the information presented easily. Many mirror screening applications have been introduced and have been brought on the front to filter out the best in the market; however, the method involving sharing the screen to the PC or other associated devices have been recognized as quite simple and effective in performance. This article provides Honor X7b users, in specific, a list of solutions that can act as the easiest and the most convenient in allowing them to share their screen with a PC.

## Part 1: Why Need Screen Mirroring?

If we consider the traditional and conventional methods of connecting AV cables, HDMI's, or VGA adapters for connecting smaller screened devices to larger screens, these methods present too much work and a series of protocols that potentially outdated the system completely. In the environment that we survive in, it is significant for us to understand that presenters keep their data intact on their smartphones and have it efficiently shared among his colleagues before the discussion. The wireless screen technology enables presenters to pose such a system into power, which not only increases the mobility but the efficiency of the system too without any unnecessary delays in connecting the Honor X7b device with a larger platform. Screen mirroring can be set as the most optimal solution to such issues, which would not only allow you to enjoy presenting but save a lot of effort before developing the frame of presentation.
