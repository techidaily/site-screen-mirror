## Part 1: Cast Contents of iPhone and Android to Computer with MirrorGo

Sometimes the smaller Android or iPhone screen isn’t enough to accurately manage the app or files available on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device. Under such circumstances, the best solution is to cast Honor Magic Vs 2 to PC using a mirroring application.

[Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/) is the safest option to perform such an activity, no matter the phone’s platform is Android or iOS. The app offers you to display your phone’s games, videos, and similar files to the much larger computer screen, where it is easy to complete the task at hand.

**Step 1: Download MirrorGo and Connect the Phone with PC**

MirrorGo is available for Windows PC. Download the application and launch it on the Honor Magic Vs 2 device. You will need to connect the Android phone with a USB cable. On the other hand, the iOS device needs to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the PC.

**Step 2: Log in with Same credentials**

To enable casting with an Android device, you need to tap on the Developer Option 7 times under the About Phone button. After that, navigate to Additional Settings, where you need to toggle-on USB Debugging.

### Screen Casting vs. Screen Mirroring: What's the Difference?

You might have heard of screencasting and screen mirroring together many times. It may come as a surprise to you that these two terminologies hold considerable differences from each other. To simplify the difference, screencasting is performed with the motive of displaying the content of the screen on another output display in the same room.
