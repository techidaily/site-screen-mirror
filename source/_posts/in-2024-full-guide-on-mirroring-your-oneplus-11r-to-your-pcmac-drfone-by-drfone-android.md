**Step 1: Download, Install and Launch**

Users are requested to download the latest version of MirrorGo from their official website. Once installed, launch the application on the computer.

**Step 2: Same Internet Connection**

The user needs to ensure that the PC and Android device are connected across the same Wi-Fi connection. Once done, tap on the option of “Mirror OnePlus 11R PC via Wi-Fi” on the lower bottom of the application’s interface.

**Step 3: Attach through USB over Unsuccessful Connection**

If the user fails to mirror the OnePlus 11R device directly through Wi-Fi, they can connect their Android device with the PC via USB. Before that, it is important to turn on USB Debugging across the Android device for successful connection. Once the phone appears under "Select a device to connect," you can remove the Android phone from the USB connection.
