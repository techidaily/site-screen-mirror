## How to Screen Share Mac to Apple iPhone 6 Plus?

You all might have heard of screen mirroring platforms providing the basic services of extrapolating the screen experience of a user from a smaller view to a larger view, such as, from an iPad screen to a Mac OS PC. You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

## Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 6 Plus with Apple's solution?

If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices through an Apple's solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.

Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.

### What You Need?

- Your Mac should be updated to the macOS Catalina – with a Mac that is both compatible for Catalina and allows you to operate Sidecar.
- iPad that runs over iPadOS 13 or above.
- The iPad and Mac should be logged in under a similar iCloud account for a successful screen share.
- A wireless connection requires you to stay within 10m of the premises of your Mac.

### Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina

With a compatible and working Mac and iPad, you can easily set up a screen mirroring environment across your devices by following the guidelines offered as follows.

**Step 1: Connect your iPad**

You need to configure setting up your iPad either through a USB connection with the Mac or through a Bluetooth connection. It is preferable to set up a wired connection for better and efficient, lag-less results.

**Step 2: AirPlay Options**

Approach your Mac and tap on the “AirPlay” icon present on the top of the menu bar. It can be observed across the top-right of your Mac’s screen.

**Step 3: Connect with iPad**

With the iPad listed in the options, simply tap on it to extend your Mac’s screen onto the iPad with ease.

**Step 4: Change Screen Options**

If you are up for mirroring the screen of your Mac onto the iPad, you need to slightly amend the settings available. Tap on the "Screen" icon that is being displayed across the status bar after a successful connection. Change the settings from "Use as Separate Display" to "Mirror Built-in Retina Display." A similar procedure can also be executed through accessing the "Sidecar" section from the "System Preferences" of your Mac.

## Part 1. What Is Screen Mirroring?

To understand what screen mirroring is, it is important to know what it is not. So, screen mirroring is neither sharing software nor media streaming nor does it involve the use of physical connectors such as HDMI or various other cables.

It is a wireless mirroring of data from a screen-sending device to a screen-receiving device. Users who have screens mirrored can access files, control mobile notifications, manage applications, take screenshots, stream movies, and more while controlling their iPhones. Some methods of screen mirroring can also enable reverse control.

Screen mirroring can work with the presence of a local Wi-Fi network, or without one – but a USB in that case is essential. Ideally, either device should be in the same room. The terminology of screen mirroring cannot be explained in simpler words. Therefore, we will next look at how screen mirroring works.

## Part 2. How Does Screen Mirroring Work?

As mentioned earlier, there needs to be a receiver and a sender for screen mirroring to work. Besides, there are also a few screens mirroring protocols to follow, such as the presence of hardware or software receivers on the receiving devices.

An example of a hardware receiver is an Apple TV, Chromecast, and many others. A software receiver is a device that uses a software application like Reflector to turn an existing device into a screen-receiver – as applicable on Mac or Windows computers.

There are several ways to establish connections for screen mirroring. Devices that are not compatible with the mirroring wirelessly can create technological barriers for bigger settings. Fortunately, there are third-party solutions that can bridge the gap and enable compatible devices to mirror screens.

**Step 1:** Make sure either device is connected to the same local network or Wi-Fi

**Step 2:** Opening the Control system on iPhone/iPad

**Step 3:** Tapping on the "Screen mirroring" or "AirPlay" option (if you are unable to find the AirPlay button, download "Mirroring Assist" from PlayStore and follow the instructions)

**Step 4:** Selecting your compatible computer, such as Windows, Mac, or Chromebooks, to mirror

**Note:** For android users, you must have the Mirroring360 sender downloaded. By launching the app, it will automatically detect a receiver to which you can connect.
