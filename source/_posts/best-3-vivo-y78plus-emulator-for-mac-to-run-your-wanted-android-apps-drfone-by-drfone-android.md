**Step 3: Run Scrcpy File**

After enabling the USB Debugging mode, you need to re-launch the .exe file on your computer and allow all the prompt messages received on your phone. This will conclusively mirror your Vivo Y78+ screen to PC without any discrepancies. However, it should be kept in mind that the process elapses as soon as you detach your phone from the USB connection.

## Part 4: Screen Mirroring Vivo Y78+ to PC Wirelessly – Vysor

Vysor has presented itself as a very strong screen mirroring application for Android phones such as Xiaomi. It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Vivo Y78+ to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone's battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Vivo Y78+ to your PC.

**Step 1: Initiate USB Debugging on your Phone**

You need to have USB debugging enabled on your phone to connect your Vivo Y78+ through the ADB connection. If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.

**Step 2: Open Command Prompt on PC**
