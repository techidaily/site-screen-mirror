## Part 2: How to Mirror Apple iPhone 13 mini to Roku with Video & TV Cast for Roku?

Now that you have set up Roku’s mirroring functions, you are ready to put it into action. One of the main reasons that Roku is so popular is its wide range of compatibility with different Apple devices – you can use this app with any version of an Apple iPhone 13 mini or iPad.

1\. Ensure that you have correctly installed the Roku app on your Apple iPhone 13 mini or iPad. You can get it from [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roku/id482066631?mt=8).

2\. Once the installation process is complete, launch the app on your device.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242176713.jpg)

3\. If you do not have a Roku account, create a free account at this stage. If you already have an account, now is the time to sign in. At this stage, connect to your TV via the app.

4\. From the toolbar at the bottom, select the “Play On Roku” option.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242341845.jpg)

5\. Now, choose the content that you wish to display on a bigger screen. You can choose from music, videos, and images. You must select the correct format in order to view your content. For example, if you choose video, then you can only play a video from your phone.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242576062.jpg)

6\. At this point, the content will be mirrored on your TV screen, and you can enjoy a viewing experience on a larger screen. Simple!

## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone 13 mini to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone 13 mini device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone 13 mini or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!
