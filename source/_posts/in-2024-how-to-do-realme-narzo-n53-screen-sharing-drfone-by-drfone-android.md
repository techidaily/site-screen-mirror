![samsung devices featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Realme Narzo N53  Phone to  Realme TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Realme Narzo N53  devices that allows you to **screen share on Realme Narzo N53 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Realme Narzo N53  device to your  Realme TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Realme Narzo N53  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Realme Narzo N53  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Realme Narzo N53  users to share their device's screen with  Realme TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Realme TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2011 LED D7000 and above, PDP D8000 and above.
- 2012 LED ES7500 and above, PDP E8000 and above.
- 2013 LED F4500 and above (except F9000 and above), PDP F5500 and above.
- 2014 H4500, H5500 and above (except H6003/H6103/H6153/H6201/H6203).
- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Realme TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

Before explaining the steps, it is important to state that available screens and settings may change depending on your device, Smart TV, or service provider. The Smart View feature is also unavailable on all Samsung devices, and you might need to use the Smart View or Smart Things app.

Ensure that your Samsung device and Smart TV are connected to the same network, and follow these steps for screen sharing:

**Step 1:** After connecting your device and Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network, open the "Quick Panel" on your Samsung device. Here, press and enable "Smart View."

## How to Cast Realme Narzo N53 Screen to PC Using WiFi

Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let's discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme Narzo N53 devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme Narzo N53 device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

### 3) Twonky Beam

Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144384235.jpg)

### 4) AllShare

For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn't come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme Narzo N53 device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 5) Android HiFi and AirBubble

There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.

### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

### 9) Using the DS Video

One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.

### 10) AirStream

Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices. However, before you go on to install this app; we must notice that it is necessary for you to root your device. Alongside this, there is a short payment that must be made to enjoy all its features. Otherwise, it is a great app to have.
