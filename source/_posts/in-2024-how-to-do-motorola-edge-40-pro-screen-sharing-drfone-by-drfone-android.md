## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Motorola Edge 40 Pro  Phone to  Motorola TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Motorola Edge 40 Pro  devices that allows you to **screen share on Motorola Edge 40 Pro ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Motorola Edge 40 Pro  device to your  Motorola TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Motorola Edge 40 Pro  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Motorola TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

## How to Cast Motorola Edge 40 Pro Screen to PC Using WiFi

Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let's discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.


## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting
