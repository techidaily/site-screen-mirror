**Step 2: Same Internet Connection**

The user needs to ensure that the PC and Android device are connected across the same Wi-Fi connection. Once done, tap on the option of “Mirror Vivo V29 PC via Wi-Fi” on the lower bottom of the application’s interface.

**Step 3: Attach through USB over Unsuccessful Connection**

If the user fails to mirror the Vivo V29 device directly through Wi-Fi, they can connect their Android device with the PC via USB. Before that, it is important to turn on USB Debugging across the Android device for successful connection. Once the phone appears under "Select a device to connect," you can remove the Android phone from the USB connection.
