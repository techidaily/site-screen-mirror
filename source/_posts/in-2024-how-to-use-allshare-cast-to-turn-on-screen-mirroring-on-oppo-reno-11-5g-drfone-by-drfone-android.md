## Part 4: Screen Mirroring Oppo Reno 11 5G to PC Wirelessly – Vysor

Vysor has presented itself as a very strong screen mirroring application for Android phones such as Xiaomi. It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Oppo Reno 11 5G to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone's battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Oppo Reno 11 5G to your PC.

**Step 1: Initiate USB Debugging on your Phone**

You need to have USB debugging enabled on your phone to connect your Oppo Reno 11 5G through the ADB connection. If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.

**Step 2: Open Command Prompt on PC**

**Step 3: Locate your IP Address**

Following this, you need to locate the IP address of your Xiaomi. If you have a phone with an OS version below 6.0, type in:

Conversely, for phones greater than Android 7, sulk in:

Adb shell

ifconfig

A list shall appear on the Command Prompt, showing a list of all the local IP addresses associated with the computer. You need to locate the IP address of your Oppo Reno 11 5G Android phone and have it copied on the clipboard.

**Step 4: Close and Re-Type IP Address**

![retype-your-ip-address](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-2.jpg)

**Step 5: Remove USB Cable and Confirm Connection**

Following this, you need to remove the USB cable and continue using your phone using the ADB connection through the Wi-Fi and Hotspot connection of your phone. To confirm, you can check the Oppo Reno 11 5G device connected through Vysor to observe it active on the list.
