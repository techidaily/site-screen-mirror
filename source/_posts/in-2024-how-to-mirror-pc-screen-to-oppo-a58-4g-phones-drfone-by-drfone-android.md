Another feature presented by AirMirror is its remote control, where you can control the Android device's screen and operate different applications through a mouse and a keyboard. It even provides you the option of transferring files through a local network or the Internet. Conclusively, you can control every feature of the phone with the help of the computer’s remote control.
