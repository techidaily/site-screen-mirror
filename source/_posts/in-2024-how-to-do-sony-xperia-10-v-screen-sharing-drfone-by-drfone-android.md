## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Sony Xperia 10 V  Phone to  Sony TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Sony Xperia 10 V  devices that allows you to **screen share on Sony Xperia 10 V ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
