## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.
