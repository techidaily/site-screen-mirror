## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Samsung Galaxy F34 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.
