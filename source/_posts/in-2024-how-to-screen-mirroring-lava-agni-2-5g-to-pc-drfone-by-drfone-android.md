**Review**: "This app is great for accessing my PC from my phone! The "touch screen as a mouse" is actually easy to use, and connecting to my PC is pretty fast. My only complaint is that the button to open the keyboard hides after a few seconds, then occasionally, I can't get that menu to return. This is the menu at the top where you can access the keyboard, settings, etc."
