## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Tecno Phantom V Flip  Phone to  Tecno TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Tecno Phantom V Flip  devices that allows you to **screen share on Tecno Phantom V Flip ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Tecno TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:
