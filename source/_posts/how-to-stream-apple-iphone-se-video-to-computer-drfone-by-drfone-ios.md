## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone SE video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone SE across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone SE onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone SE has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone SE to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.

## Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone SE video to PC with VLC Streamer

To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.

FaceTime can be another great technique to consider screen sharing Apple iPhone with other people. If you wish to show something important to some people, you can dial them through FaceTime and share the important thing in no time. FaceTime has recently adopted the SharePlay technology to give a wholesome experience in screen sharing.

Users with iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, or later can initiate a FaceTime call with the Music or Apple TV app for sharing music or video content, respectively. Where the applications can change, the process remains the same. FaceTime is quite diverse in functionality, which involves sharing the iPhone's screen.

### What Are the Requirements?

- iPhones and iPads running on iOS/iPadOS 15.4 and above allows users to start the FaceTime call through the Apple TV app (+ other supported streaming apps) and Music app (+ other music app alternatives). Then, they can use SharePlay for video/music sharing via the call with other participants.
- To screen share Apple iPhone SE to iPhone via FaceTime, the person sharing the content and the recipient should both have iOS 15.1+ (iPhones), macOS 12.1+ (Mac), or iPadOS 15.1+ (iPads).
- Users need Apple ID to access FaceTime.

With all these provisions in mind, you must follow the steps explained below to share your Apple iPhone SE screen over FaceTime with ease:
