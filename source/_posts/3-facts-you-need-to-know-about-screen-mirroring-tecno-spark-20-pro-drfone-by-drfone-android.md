## A Guide Tecno Spark 20 Pro Wireless and Wired Screen Mirroring

In simple words, screen mirroring is an approach to mirror the screens of two devices with one another. For instance, you can mirror your Android phone screen on the computer and the other way round. In this article, viewers will get to know how to mirror an Android screen on PC wirelessly or through a USB cable.

Screen Mirroring is quite useful in many ways. It allows you to display the screen of your Android phone, tablet, or PC on another device through a wired or wireless connection between both devices. In today’s life, not everyone is familiar with screen mirroring technology.

## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring?

Screen Mirroring is such technology that permits you to display your content from your device to another device. In the case of screen mirroring Tecno Spark 20 Pro PC, this could be done through both wireless and wired connections.

In a meeting or presentation, screen mirroring plays an important role by facilitating team members to avoid complex setups and share their screens immediately. Moreover, screen mirroring supports the BYOD model, that is, "Bring Your Own Device." The reason for supporting this model is to lower the cost and increase efficiency.
