## Part 5: How to Mirror Phone to Computer with Dr.Fone Air

While you have looked into some great solutions **to cast your phone to a PC,** there is another tool that provides a similar experience in mirroring the screen of your phone onto a computer screen. [Wondershare Dr.Fone Air](https://drfoneair.wondershare.com/) is a great online tool designed for mirroring the phone's screen onto the computer for free.
