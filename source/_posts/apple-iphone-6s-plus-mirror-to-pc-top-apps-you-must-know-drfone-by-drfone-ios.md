## Method 3: Share Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus Screen Over FaceTime (SharePlay)

FaceTime can be another great technique to consider screen sharing Apple iPhone with other people. If you wish to show something important to some people, you can dial them through FaceTime and share the important thing in no time. FaceTime has recently adopted the SharePlay technology to give a wholesome experience in screen sharing.

Users with iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, or later can initiate a FaceTime call with the Music or Apple TV app for sharing music or video content, respectively. Where the applications can change, the process remains the same. FaceTime is quite diverse in functionality, which involves sharing the iPhone's screen.

### What Are the Requirements?

- iPhones and iPads running on iOS/iPadOS 15.4 and above allows users to start the FaceTime call through the Apple TV app (+ other supported streaming apps) and Music app (+ other music app alternatives). Then, they can use SharePlay for video/music sharing via the call with other participants.
- To screen share Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone via FaceTime, the person sharing the content and the recipient should both have iOS 15.1+ (iPhones), macOS 12.1+ (Mac), or iPadOS 15.1+ (iPads).
- Users need Apple ID to access FaceTime.

With all these provisions in mind, you must follow the steps explained below to share your Apple iPhone 6s Plus screen over FaceTime with ease:

**Step 1:** You must start a FaceTime call and connect with your respective personnel. As you connect successfully, select the "Share Content" button on the top of the screen to start screen sharing.

**Step 3:** To end the screen sharing, you will have to tap on the "Share Content" button again to disconnect screen sharing.

## Method 4: Share Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus Screen to a Mac or Windows PC Using a Third-Party App
