## Part 1. What Is Screen Mirroring?

To understand what screen mirroring is, it is important to know what it is not. So, screen mirroring is neither sharing software nor media streaming nor does it involve the use of physical connectors such as HDMI or various other cables.

It is a wireless mirroring of data from a screen-sending device to a screen-receiving device. Users who have screens mirrored can access files, control mobile notifications, manage applications, take screenshots, stream movies, and more while controlling their iPhones. Some methods of screen mirroring can also enable reverse control.

Screen mirroring can work with the presence of a local Wi-Fi network, or without one – but a USB in that case is essential. Ideally, either device should be in the same room. The terminology of screen mirroring cannot be explained in simpler words. Therefore, we will next look at how screen mirroring works.

## Part 2. How Does Screen Mirroring Work?

As mentioned earlier, there needs to be a receiver and a sender for screen mirroring to work. Besides, there are also a few screens mirroring protocols to follow, such as the presence of hardware or software receivers on the receiving devices.

An example of a hardware receiver is an Apple TV, Chromecast, and many others. A software receiver is a device that uses a software application like Reflector to turn an existing device into a screen-receiver – as applicable on Mac or Windows computers.

There are several ways to establish connections for screen mirroring. Devices that are not compatible with the mirroring wirelessly can create technological barriers for bigger settings. Fortunately, there are third-party solutions that can bridge the gap and enable compatible devices to mirror screens.
