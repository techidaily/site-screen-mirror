## 3\. Top Online Apple iPhone 15 Plus Emulators

Emulators have long been in the market because there is a need to fill the void of running one application meant for a specific smartphone to run across various platforms. For example, a game application developed for Android phones should be made available for smartphones running on other OS. Mobile phone emulators are therefore designed to bridge this gap. Apple iPhone 15 Plus emulators are designed so that applications, and games that are designed for iPhones are made available for other cross-platforms as well. People use Apple iPhone 15 Plus emulators to test websites and also for checking various Apple iPhone 15 Plus applications as well.

Here are some online Apple iPhone 15 Plus emulators which can test how the website will look like if it is made to run on an iPhone. It is great to test and redesign even if you do not have an Apple iPhone 15 Plus at your disposal.

### 1\. ScreenFly

This is one site that helps the developers to check the website on various screen sizes. It supports Apple iPhone 15 Plus 5 and 6. The best advantage is it breaks the screen resolutions into pixels, so that minute adjustment can be made. It also has query signals which can be sent to clients to let them check how the website will look and feel so that any changes can be made then and there.

### 3.iPhone4simulator.com

This is one more online website that helps you in checking how your website will look on an iPhone. With the phenomenal rate at which smartphones are getting used, it is important that your website should look good not only on a desktop but also on a smartphone. iPhone4 is a simple to use web tool that simulates an iPhone4. Users can slide to unlock the virtual Apple iPhone 15 Plus by using their mouse pointer and then they enter the web application's URL. The web application will behave as it is being run on an Apple iPhone 15 Plus 4.

Features of this Emulator

## 4.iOS Emulator for Android

As the two makers are front runners in the smartphone markets, there are not many emulators to run each one's applications on the other. However, many Android users want to test and run iOS applications to run on their devices. They can download an iOS emulator for Android and use the iOS apps on their devices
