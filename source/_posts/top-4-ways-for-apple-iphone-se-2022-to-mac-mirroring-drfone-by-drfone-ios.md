To know more about these problems, let's look ahead to figure out which one of the issues might be causing issues for you while **casting from Apple iPhone SE (2022) to MacBook:**

- It is possible that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) devices in use for screencasting are not compatible. For that, you must check the Apple iPhone SE (2022) devices to figure out if they are compatible and supports AirPlay.
