## Part 1. Benefits of Using a Screen Mirroring App for iPhone and iPad

Yes, screen mirroring is helpful in many ways, which prompts users to opt for solutions that allow the process. But what are the benefits you can expect from downloading and using this software on iPad or iPhone devices? Let's get to know some of the best ones.

- **Streaming videos/movies-** Many users prefer using different streaming services on smartphones and tablets. But the screen size and resolution can be smaller in these devices, decreasing user experience. With the **best free screen mirroring app for iPhone,** you can reflect the content from smaller devices to more giant monitors.
- **Game mirroring-** Some of the best games are available only as mobile apps, and many users want to view the gameplay on more giant screens. A screen mirroring tool is helpful here.
- **Business presentation-** In business meetings or conferences, a professional may have to show the entire presentation of a project plan, some documentation, or a software tutorial to all participants. For this, projecting the video on a bigger screen quickly through an app is valuable.
- **No support for AirPlay-** The preset screen mirroring feature on iPhones and iPads is AirPlay. It is helpful for high-quality projection across devices. However, it is incompatible with various apps, like video streaming platforms. So, users have to use an alternative app for the task, which we shall discuss here, starting with Dr.Fone Air.
