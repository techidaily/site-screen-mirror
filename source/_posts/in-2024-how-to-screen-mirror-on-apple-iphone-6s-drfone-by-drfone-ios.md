## Part 1: Cast Your Apple iPhone 6s to Mac via AirPlay \[Best Choice\]

AirPlay is the dedicated technique available to cast the iPhone onto a Mac. While this is the direct option Apple provides for its devices, it is pretty simple to cover. You need to process a few basic steps to **cast to MacBook** with the help of this functionality. However, there are multiple drawbacks to using AirPlay in casting devices, which shall be discussed later.

Before that, let's look into how you can cast your Apple iPhone 6s to Mac using AirPlay:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, you will have to connect the iPhone and the Mac to the same Wi-Fi network. Afterward, access the "Control Center" of your Apple iPhone 6s. For iPhone X and later models, you have to swipe from the top-right corner, while for iPhone 8 or earlier models, the Control Center can be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

**Step 2:** Select "Screen Mirroring" from the available options and hold the particular button.

**Step 3:** You will be led to a new screen where you must discover your Mac device and select it. For a successful connection, you might need to add the AirPlay code provided on the screen of your Mac.

To know more about these problems, let's look ahead to figure out which one of the issues might be causing issues for you while **casting from Apple iPhone 6s to MacBook:**
