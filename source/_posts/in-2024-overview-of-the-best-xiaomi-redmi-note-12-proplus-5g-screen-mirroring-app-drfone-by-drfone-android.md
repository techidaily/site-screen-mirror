This app is the best I've found, with more than adequate performance."

**How Does MirrorOp Work:**

MirrorOp is available on the PlayStore and can be downloaded easily. Before mirroring your Android with a PC, make sure that your Android is rooted.

- • Install AirDroid on your system via [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sand.airdroid&hl=en)
- • Set up your AirDroid account by running the application.
- • AirDroid will now ask you for enabling its service. Tap on Enable for doing so. A Pop up will appear now, just tap on OK for the service.
- • Enable the Find My Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G function by turning it on and tapping on the Activate option.
- • Another Android setting menu will appear on your device. Tap on Activate and your Mac and device will now become compatible with each other.
- • Now install the AirDroid app on your Mac and run the installation program. Launch the file after the installation is complete.
- • Enter the same login and password which you did in your AirDroid app on your device.
- • Now you can run the files on your device easily on your computer.
