![scrcpy-interface](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/mirror-android-to-pc-1.jpg)

**Pros:**

## Part 4: AirMirror

AirMirror is another impressive platform that provides highly efficient and high-quality features for mirroring Android on PC. AirDroid developed a feature under the name of AirMirror that allows you to control the Android screen through a wireless connection. Many conventional applications required for screen mirroring Vivo V27 PC calls for rooting your Android device. AirMirror, on the other hand, does not demand the rooting of your Android device. Another feature presented by AirMirror is its remote control, where you can control the Android device's screen and operate different applications through a mouse and a keyboard. It even provides you the option of transferring files through a local network or the Internet.
