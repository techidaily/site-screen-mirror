## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro  Phone to  Nubia TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro  devices that allows you to **screen share on Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
