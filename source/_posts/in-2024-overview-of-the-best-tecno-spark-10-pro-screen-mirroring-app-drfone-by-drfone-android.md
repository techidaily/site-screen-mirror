## Part 4: Screen Mirroring Tecno Spark 10 Pro to PC Wirelessly – Vysor

Vysor has presented itself as a very strong screen mirroring application for Android phones such as Xiaomi. It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Tecno Spark 10 Pro to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone's battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Tecno Spark 10 Pro to your PC.

**Step 1: Initiate USB Debugging on your Phone**

If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.

A list shall appear on the Command Prompt, showing a list of all the local IP addresses associated with the computer. You need to locate the IP address of your Tecno Spark 10 Pro Android phone and have it copied on the clipboard.

**Step 4: Close and Re-Type IP Address**

You need to exit the ADB window to re-type the IP address for connecting your PC with the phone. Type ‘ADB shell’ to exit the window; however, keep the terminal open. Retype the IP address on the screen.

**Step 5: Remove USB Cable and Confirm Connection**

To confirm, you can check the Tecno Spark 10 Pro device connected through Vysor to observe it active on the list. You can simply connect to the phone in a normal manner for screen mirroring Tecno Spark 10 Pro to PC.
