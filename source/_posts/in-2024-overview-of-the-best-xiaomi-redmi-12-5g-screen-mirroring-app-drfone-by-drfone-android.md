I don't have interference between my mobile & Wi-Fi adapter. If it wasn't for the lag, I'd give this 5 stars. The only fix I see is lowering the res, but I actually need HD. Lowering it would defeat my purpose."

### 5\. ApowerMirror - Cast Screen of Android to PC with Audio

If you wish to cast the screen of your Android device to a Smart TV or a computer with sound, ApowerMirror turns out to be quite useful.

I've looked for an app like this, but others require rooting your phone or using a web-based system to control your phone through their servers. This app is the best I've found, with more than adequate performance."
