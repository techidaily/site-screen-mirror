## How to Cast Tecno Spark 10 4G Screen to PC Using WiFi

Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let's discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.


## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Tecno Spark 10 4G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Tecno Spark 10 4G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!

**Price:** Free

**Rating**: 3.2/5

**Review**: "Works, but having issues with the remote session's scaling after pulling down the keyboard for remote input. When you collapse the virtual keyboard and try to use the mouse to click on things, the cursor is offset from what is shown on the screen. So you have to aim off by some degree to click on things you intend to click on. Rather annoying. Need to disconnect and reconnect every time to restore functionality."
