## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

**Review**: "Okay, so for the most part, I like this. However, I run into lag issues after a while. Sure this is over Wi-Fi, but it shouldn't do that. I don't have interference between my mobile & Wi-Fi adapter. If it wasn't for the lag, I'd give this 5 stars. The only fix I see is lowering the res, but I actually need HD. Lowering it would defeat my purpose."
