## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Nokia XR21  Phone to  Nokia TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Nokia XR21  devices that allows you to **screen share on Nokia XR21 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
