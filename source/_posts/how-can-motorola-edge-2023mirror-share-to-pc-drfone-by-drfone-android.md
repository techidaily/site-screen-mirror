In this article, we’ll be talking about the PC screen mirroring to Android and discuss what platforms offer better service than the rest.

## Part 1. Mirror PC Screen to Android - Can I Cast Screen from Windows to Android?

Yes, you can mirror your computer’s screen to your Android phone. It means that you will be able to remotely access and manage the PC screen with an Android Screen. Such convenience is handy for developers, teachers, and pretty much every professional who has to deal with both PC and phone daily.

Screencasting or mirroring is also possible on a phone that isn’t rooted. However, there are a few things that you have to do from the phone’s settings menu to enable PC mirroring. It is called USB debugging. The method to debug the Android phone is as follows:

1\. You would need to connect the Android phone to the computer via USB cable to initiate the procedure;

2\. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;

3\. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;

4\. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;

5\. You will see the Build Number of the Motorola Edge 2023 device. Tap on the option 7 times. It will bring the Motorola Edge 2023 device into developer mode;

6\. Repeat Step 2!

7\. Enable USB Debugging and tap on OK to grant permission.

Once you switch on the USB Debugging, the other thing you should remember is that the Android device and the PC need to be connected to the same WiFi network. Otherwise, the process of mirroring won’t work.

In the next section of the article, we will look into the top three apps to mirror PC screen to Android. We will discuss the pros and cons of all of them. It will assist you in finally choosing the most suitable app to use the Android device to mirror your PC’s screen.
