While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well.

However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Realme 10T 5G  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Realme 10T 5G  users to share their device's screen with  Realme TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Realme TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2011 LED D7000 and above, PDP D8000 and above.
- 2012 LED ES7500 and above, PDP E8000 and above.
- 2013 LED F4500 and above (except F9000 and above), PDP F5500 and above.

- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Realme TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

Before explaining the steps, it is important to state that available screens and settings may change depending on your device, Smart TV, or service provider. The Smart View feature is also unavailable on all Samsung devices, and you might need to use the Smart View or Smart Things app.

Ensure that your Samsung device and Smart TV are connected to the same network, and follow these steps for screen sharing:

**Step 1:** After connecting your device and Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network, open the "Quick Panel" on your Samsung device. Here, press and enable "Smart View."

**Step 2:** Select your  Realme TV among the available devices when Smart View is enabled. Once connected, choose the content you want to share on the TV screen.
