## How to Screen Share Mac to Apple iPhone 7?

You all might have heard of screen mirroring platforms providing the basic services of extrapolating the screen experience of a user from a smaller view to a larger view, such as, from an iPad screen to a Mac OS PC. You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 7.

## Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 7 with Apple's solution?

If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone 7 devices through an Apple's solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.

Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.
