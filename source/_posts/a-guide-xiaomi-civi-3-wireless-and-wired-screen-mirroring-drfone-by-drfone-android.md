- Tap on your Roku device to start sharing your Android screen with the Roku device.
- You must ensure that your Android device is functioning on version 4.4.2 or above before following this method. Also, you need to make sure that your Roku and your Android device is connected to the same network.

### Method 2: Use Screen Mirroring App to Mirror Xiaomi Civi 3 to Roku

Screen Mirroring App for Roku is an easy to use application that allows sharing pictures, videos, and documents from your Android device to Roku TV.

The data is solely captured by the application for mirroring purposes only; no information is stored.

The only drawback of this app is that it still does not support sound; hence to share sound, you need to use Bluetooth speakers.

**Step 1: Download the Screen Mirroring Application:**

- Unlock your Android device and enter the Google Play Store.
- Download the "Screen Mirroring Application" using this link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku)
