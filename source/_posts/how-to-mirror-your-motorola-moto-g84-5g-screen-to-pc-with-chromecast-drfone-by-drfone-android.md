## Final Words

This article covers everything about screen mirroring and its working with the need to cast Android screen to PC. We have discussed the concept of screen mirroring both by wired or wireless connection. With the help of this article, you can now share your Android screen on a laptop or PC and can share data like documents, images, games, etc.

Furthermore, Wondershare introduces us to software like MirrorGo. It helps us to build a wireless connection between devices that we want to connect for screen mirroring purposes.
