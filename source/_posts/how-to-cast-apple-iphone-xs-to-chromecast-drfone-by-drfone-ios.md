## Part 1. What Is Screen Mirroring?

To understand what screen mirroring is, it is important to know what it is not. So, screen mirroring is neither sharing software nor media streaming nor does it involve the use of physical connectors such as HDMI or various other cables.

It is a wireless mirroring of data from a screen-sending device to a screen-receiving device. Users who have screens mirrored can access files, control mobile notifications, manage applications, take screenshots, stream movies, and more while controlling their iPhones. Some methods of screen mirroring can also enable reverse control.

Screen mirroring can work with the presence of a local Wi-Fi network, or without one – but a USB in that case is essential. Ideally, either device should be in the same room. The terminology of screen mirroring cannot be explained in simpler words. Therefore, we will next look at how screen mirroring works.

## Part 2. How Does Screen Mirroring Work?

As mentioned earlier, there needs to be a receiver and a sender for screen mirroring to work. Besides, there are also a few screens mirroring protocols to follow, such as the presence of hardware or software receivers on the receiving devices.

An example of a hardware receiver is an Apple TV, Chromecast, and many others. A software receiver is a device that uses a software application like Reflector to turn an existing device into a screen-receiver – as applicable on Mac or Windows computers.

There are several ways to establish connections for screen mirroring. Devices that are not compatible with the mirroring wirelessly can create technological barriers for bigger settings. Fortunately, there are third-party solutions that can bridge the gap and enable compatible devices to mirror screens.

Mirroring360 is an application that allows an iPhone screen to mirror to a PC. The AirPlay technology made by Apple supports mirroring from the screen-sending device, whereas the mirroring360 application achieves compatibility with the screen-receiver device, which is a PC or a laptop.

A few tidbits to be mindful of when installing mirroring360 are:

- Mirroring Android requires installing mirroring360 sender on a compatible Android device.
- Mirroring Windows requires installing of mirroring360 sender to the PC
- Mirroring a Chromebook requires installing Chrome browser extensions.

The next time you want to watch a video clip with your friends, use the screen mirroring feature to search for them on your smartphone and cast it on a TV or PC.

Before getting onto mirroring the screens, make sure the mirroring device is compatible to support the feature. Once you have that installed for Windows or Mac, you can start mirroring an iPhone or iPad by:

**Step 1:** Make sure either device is connected to the same local network or Wi-Fi

**Step 2:** Opening the Control system on iPhone/iPad

**Step 3:** Tapping on the "Screen mirroring" or "AirPlay" option (if you are unable to find the AirPlay button, download "Mirroring Assist" from PlayStore and follow the instructions)

**Step 4:** Selecting your compatible computer, such as Windows, Mac, or Chromebooks, to mirror

**Note:** For android users, you must have the Mirroring360 sender downloaded. By launching the app, it will automatically detect a receiver to which you can connect.
