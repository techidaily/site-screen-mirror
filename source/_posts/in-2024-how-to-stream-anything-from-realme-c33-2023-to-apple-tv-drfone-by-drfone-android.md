As it is a wireless solution, you have to cover the complete process with the help of a Wi-Fi connection. Rather than **casting the Android screen to a PC,** you can realize this solution as a perfect option for covering lectures, meetings, and other uses.

### Key Features Provided by the Online Screen Mirroring Solution

There are some prominent features of this online mirroring solution that makes it a special choice in the market. Let's find out more about these features below:

### What is the Disadvantage of Screen Casting?

Screen casting, as a process, is not better than screen mirroring. Essentially, this process does not allow you to use the mobile when it is connected to the computer. If you have connected your Android to the PC through screencasting, you will have to disconnect it to use the mobile phone.
