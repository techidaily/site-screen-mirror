Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone 15 Pro video to a computer.


## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 15 Pro video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 15 Pro across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 15 Pro onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 15 Pro has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.

## Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone 15 Pro video to PC with VLC Streamer

There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone 15 Pro videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around.

To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.
