**Step 2: Open Computer Receiver**

After ensuring that the PC, as well as the mobile phone, are connected over the same Wi-Fi device, you need to initiate the process by opening the AllCast Receiver through the Chrome Application Launcher.

**Step 3: Initiate Mirror Share**

After getting the appropriate settings on the computer, you need to propagate towards the phone. Initiate ‘Screen Recording and Mirror’ on the Motorola Moto G23.

**Step 4: Synchronize Devices**

In the options presented by "Screen Recording and Mirror," you need to access the "Network Devices" and select the appropriate desktop model. Selecting the model will start screen sharing with 'Chrome @' followed by the IP Address of the computer. This allows you to mirror your Motorola Moto G23screen to PC wirelessly through AllCast without difficulty.

## Conclusion

The perfect adoption of such issues will surely lead you to understand the system more appropriately and develop a ground where you present an effective change through this function.
