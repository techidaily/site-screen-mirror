## 3\. Top Online Apple iPhone 6s Emulators

Emulators have long been in the market because there is a need to fill the void of running one application meant for a specific smartphone to run across various platforms. For example, a game application developed for Android phones should be made available for smartphones running on other OS. Mobile phone emulators are therefore designed to bridge this gap. Apple iPhone 6s emulators are designed so that applications, and games that are designed for iPhones are made available for other cross-platforms as well. People use Apple iPhone 6s emulators to test websites and also for checking various Apple iPhone 6s applications as well.

Here are some online Apple iPhone 6s emulators which can test how the website will look like if it is made to run on an iPhone. It is great to test and redesign even if you do not have an Apple iPhone 6s at your disposal.
