### What is the Disadvantage of Screen Casting?

Screen casting, as a process, is not better than screen mirroring. Essentially, this process does not allow you to use the mobile when it is connected to the computer. If you have connected your Android to the PC through screencasting, you will have to disconnect it to use the mobile phone.
