## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Infinix Note 30 VIP  Phone to  Infinix TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Infinix Note 30 VIP  devices that allows you to **screen share on Infinix Note 30 VIP ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

## Part 5: Mirroring Android Screen to PC with Online Screen Mirroring Tool - Dr.Fone Air

With all the casting solutions provided above, it might make your experience better if you'd consider using a screen mirroring solution. [Wondershare Dr.Fone Air](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/ios-screen-mirror/) is an online screen mirroring solution that offers a quick and effective functionality to mirror the screen of your Android to a PC.

As it is a wireless solution, you have to cover the complete process with the help of a Wi-Fi connection. Rather than **casting the Android screen to a PC,** you can realize this solution as a perfect option for covering lectures, meetings, and other uses.

### Key Features Provided by the Online Screen Mirroring Solution

There are some prominent features of this online mirroring solution that makes it a special choice in the market. Let's find out more about these features below:

- You are not required to use a Bluetooth or NFC connection for mirroring the Infinix Note 30 VIP device.
- The tool is completely free and does not have any ads associated with it.
- You can adjust the mirrored screen by zooming, rotating, or taking screenshots.

### What is the Disadvantage of Screen Casting?

Screen casting, as a process, is not better than screen mirroring. Essentially, this process does not allow you to use the mobile when it is connected to the computer. If you have connected your Android to the PC through screencasting, you will have to disconnect it to use the mobile phone.
