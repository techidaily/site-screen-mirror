## Part 2: Why should you use screen mirroring?

Before discovering the applications and their guides on how to effectively utilize them for screen mirroring Apple iPhone 7 Plus to iPad, it is important for many of the people to understand the significance of screen mirroring your devices onto bigger screens. There can be many reasons for why screen mirroring is preferred in comparison to other extravagant options.

If we take the environment of an office into consideration, we can clearly demonstrate the use of screen mirroring during a meeting. At an instant, where a meeting attendee feels to add a positive contribution that he discovered on his/her iPhone, it might get extremely hard to get it circulated amongst all members. For that, he/she has to get up from their position and circle around the room, showing it to everyone sitting in the meeting. This demonstrates the decorum of the meeting, leaving the people present in the room in a very awkward and inconvenient situation. For this, you can utilize the screen mirroring feature present on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to professionally manage the situation and have your message circulated across all members of the meeting without any hiatus in the decorum of the meeting. This analogy can be implied across a school, where you need to keep a progressive environment without any disruption. For this, you need to focus on using screen mirroring applications for efficiently covering all your demands. This, however, can be covered out using a third-party screen mirroring application.
