Yes, you can mirror your computer’s screen to your Android phone. It means that you will be able to remotely access and manage the PC screen with an Android Screen. Such convenience is handy for developers, teachers, and pretty much every professional who has to deal with both PC and phone daily.

1\. You would need to connect the Android phone to the computer via USB cable to initiate the procedure;

2\. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;

3\. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;

4\. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;

5\. You will see the Build Number of the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device. Tap on the option 7 times. It will bring the Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ device into developer mode;

6\. Repeat Step 2!
