Apple has introduced a very smart feature within its devices that make them more cognitive and intuitive to device connectivity. Screen mirroring has been considered a very important and professional feature that helps you save a lot of fuss while sharing content with your colleagues or family. If you wish to show an important article or a video during an office presentation that would change the dynamics of the discussion, Apple presents its screen mirroring features operated through third-party screen mirroring applications that would allow you to share the small screen onto a larger screen. This prevents the members from standing up from their positions and look over the tiny screens by disturbing the discipline of the room. This article describes different mechanisms that allow you to execute screen mirroring on Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max successfully. These mechanisms present remedies to Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max users for connecting their phone with the computer and other big screens.

## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring on iPhone X?

Before understanding the procedures of how we can execute the screen mirroring on iPhone X, it is significant for us to understand what Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max really believes screen mirroring to be. Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max introduced a very explicit feature under the domain of screen mirror functionality, which has provided improved results when screened on PC or Mac.

## Part 2: Screen Mirroring Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Samsung TV

This part focuses on developing an understanding of iPhone users for connecting their phones onto Samsung TV through two different approaches. While believing that there are multiple approaches that can be adapted for screen mirroring Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Samsung TV, it is significant to navigate to the most appropriate version of the screen mirroring your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max X. The following methods describe the most effective and efficient approaches that can easily mirror Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max onto Samsung TV.

AirPlay 2 has been Apple's highlight in enabling screen mirroring and helping people discover pertinent ways to share their iPhone's or iPad's screen onto larger screens.

The compatibility is not confined to Apple TV but is supported for compatible Samsung TVs.

For understanding the procedure of connecting your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Samsung TV with the help of AirPlay 2, you need to follow the steps provided below.

**Step 1: Ensuring Internet Connection**

You need to ensure that the network connection connecting your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and Samsung TV is similar. It is considered as an important factor in screen mirroring iPhone X.

**Step 2: Access the Media File**

Following this, you need to open the media file that you seek to mirror onto the Samsung TV. You need to open the Photos application on the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to access the image or video that you seek to share.

**Step 3: Share the Media File**

After locating the file, you need to choose the file and tap on the 'Share' icon present on the bottom left of the screen. Select the "Airplay" icon from the link to open up a new window on the front.

**Step 1: Connect HDMI cable to the TV**

You need to attach an HDMI cable from the back of the TV after turning it on. Have the HDMI cable connected to the Lightning Digital AV Adapter.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242341845.jpg)

5\. Now, choose the content that you wish to display on a bigger screen. You can choose from music, videos, and images. You must select the correct format in order to view your content. For example, if you choose video, then you can only play a video from your phone.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242576062.jpg)

6\. At this point, the content will be mirrored on your TV screen, and you can enjoy a viewing experience on a larger screen. Simple!

## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!
