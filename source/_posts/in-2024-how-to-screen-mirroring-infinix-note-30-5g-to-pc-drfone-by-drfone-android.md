## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Infinix Note 30 5G  Phone to  Infinix TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Infinix Note 30 5G  devices that allows you to **screen share on Infinix Note 30 5G ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Infinix Note 30 5G  device to your  Infinix TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Infinix Note 30 5G  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Infinix TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:
