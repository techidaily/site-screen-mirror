## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From ZTE Axon 40 Lite  Phone to  ZTE TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in ZTE Axon 40 Lite  devices that allows you to **screen share on ZTE Axon 40 Lite ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
