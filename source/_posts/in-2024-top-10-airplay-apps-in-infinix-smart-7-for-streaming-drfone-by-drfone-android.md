Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well.

The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.
