I've looked for an app like this, but others require rooting your phone or using a web-based system to control your phone through their servers. This app is the best I've found, with more than adequate performance."

My only complaint is that the button to open the keyboard hides after a few seconds, then occasionally, I can't get that menu to return. This is the menu at the top where you can access the keyboard, settings, etc."
