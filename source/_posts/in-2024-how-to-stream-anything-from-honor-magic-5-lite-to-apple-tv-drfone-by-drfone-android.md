## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Honor Magic 5 Lite  Phone to  Honor TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Honor Magic 5 Lite  devices that allows you to **screen share on Honor Magic 5 Lite ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Honor Magic 5 Lite  device to your  Honor TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Honor Magic 5 Lite  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Honor Magic 5 Lite  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Honor Magic 5 Lite  users to share their device's screen with  Honor TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**
