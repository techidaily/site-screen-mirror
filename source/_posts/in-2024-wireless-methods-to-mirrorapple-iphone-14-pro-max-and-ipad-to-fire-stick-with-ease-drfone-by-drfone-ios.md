## How to Screen Share Mac to Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max?

You all might have heard of screen mirroring platforms providing the basic services of extrapolating the screen experience of a user from a smaller view to a larger view, such as, from an iPad screen to a Mac OS PC. You may find it peculiar, but the process also goes the other way round. Considering the need of the hour, there are certain users who cannot look over a bigger screen and prefer working across a smaller screen to save their health and time. While resting across a couch, the user will always prefer having a smaller screen to look on. Rather than carrying the weight of a bigger device with a massive screen to manage, you can simply screencast it onto a smaller range. For this, this article seeks to provide a typical guide to three easy and efficient techniques that can be easily used to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

## Part 1. How to screen share Mac to Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with Apple's solution?

If you come to the approaches that are involved in screen sharing a Mac onto an iPad, there are two basic divisions that should be immediately catered for implementation. Since Mac and iPad belong to the top-grossing, leading technology developers, Apple, it is more likely that you can simply share your screens across the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max devices through an Apple's solution. The first approach simply involves a remedy presented by the developers themselves. Although there was not a solution that has been made available by Apple initially, they came up with the idea of their own dedicated screen sharing platform in the macOS Catalina released in October 2019. This release provided Apple users with the ability to easily use their iPad as a secondary screen for the Mac. This option allowed the users to practice two different schemes in screen mirroring, i.e., to extend their display or mirror their display to watch it across a smaller and efficient screen.

Sidecar emerged as a dedicated Apple option with two different connectivity schemes. The user had the autonomy to plug their iPad with the Mac through a USB connection or have a Bluetooth connection for a wireless screen sharing from their Mac to the iPad. This efficient platform led the users onto a new era of screen mirroring, where the diversity offered by the platform is far superior to any other screencasting platform that exists in the market.

### What You Need?

- Your Mac should be updated to the macOS Catalina – with a Mac that is both compatible for Catalina and allows you to operate Sidecar.
- iPad that runs over iPadOS 13 or above.
- The iPad and Mac should be logged in under a similar iCloud account for a successful screen share.
- A wireless connection requires you to stay within 10m of the premises of your Mac.

### iPads Compatible with Sidecar

- 12.9-inch iPad Pro
- 11-inch iPad Pro
- 10.5-inch iPad Pro
- 9.7-inch iPad Pro
- iPad (6th generation or later)
- iPad mini (5th generation)
- iPad Air (3rd generation)

### Macs Compatible with Sidecar

- MacBook Pro (2016 or later)
- MacBook (2016 or later)
- MacBook Air (2018 or later)
- iMac (2017 or later, as well as 27in iMac 5K, late 2015)
- iMac Pro
- Mac mini (2018 or later)
- Mac Pro (2019)

### Using iPad as the second screen over macOS Catalina

With a compatible and working Mac and iPad, you can easily set up a screen mirroring environment across your devices by following the guidelines offered as follows.

**Step 1: Connect your iPad**

You need to configure setting up your iPad either through a USB connection with the Mac or through a Bluetooth connection. It is preferable to set up a wired connection for better and efficient, lag-less results.

**Step 2: AirPlay Options**

Approach your Mac and tap on the “AirPlay” icon present on the top of the menu bar. It can be observed across the top-right of your Mac’s screen.

**Step 3: Connect with iPad**

With the iPad listed in the options, simply tap on it to extend your Mac’s screen onto the iPad with ease.

![select your ipad device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/01/screen-share-mac-to-ipad-1.jpg)

**Step 4: Change Screen Options**

If you are up for mirroring the screen of your Mac onto the iPad, you need to slightly amend the settings available. Tap on the "Screen" icon that is being displayed across the status bar after a successful connection. Change the settings from "Use as Separate Display" to "Mirror Built-in Retina Display." A similar procedure can also be executed through accessing the "Sidecar" section from the "System Preferences" of your Mac.

![tap on mirror built in retina display option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/01/screen-share-mac-to-ipad-2.jpg)

### More Features Offered at Sidecar

Sidecar has not been introduced as a simple screen mirroring system that helps you extend your workspace or seek ease in executing a task. It provides a series of other features that typically include a virtual "Touch Bar" that is present on the iPad for managing the Mac screen through the iPad with the features offered by the specific bar. As there is an exception of no-touch input with Sidecar, the use of an Apple Pencil can help you cover this task with ease, making your iPad act as a graphic tablet. The list of iPads below can provide such a feature of Sidecar to act as a graphic tablet.

- 12.9in iPad Pro
- 11in iPad Pro
- 10.5in iPad Pro
- 9.7in iPad Pro

### How to use iPad in Screen Mirroring across Older Macs

Although macOS Catalina brought tranquility in using the screen mirroring feature across your Apple devices, there are a few platforms that can still come quite handy in managing screen mirroring across the older Macs. The use of third-party tools can guide you in managing your Mac across the iPad, which still requires you to cover a few things before moving towards the connection.

### What you Need?
