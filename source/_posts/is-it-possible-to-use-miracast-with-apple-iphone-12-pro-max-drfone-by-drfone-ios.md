## Part 2: Why Can't I AirPlay My Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to My MacBook?

There is a major problem with using AirPlay to connect the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to the MacBook. If you cannot cast your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to Mac using AirPlay, there can be multiple problems leading to this. To know more about these problems, let's look ahead to figure out which one of the issues might be causing issues for you while **casting from Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to MacBook:**

- It is possible that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max devices in use for screencasting are not compatible. For that, you must check the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max devices to figure out if they are compatible and supports AirPlay.
- As the connection is established through a Wi-Fi network, you must check whether the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max devices are connected to the same network. In other cases, it is also possible that the Wi-Fi connection is not strong enough.
- Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or Mac can cause issues with connectivity through AirPlay if they are not updated to the latest version.
- It is possible that the AirPlay connectivity is hindered between iPhone and Mac due to Firewall Settings. Therefore, you will have to disable and allow some settings for that purpose.
