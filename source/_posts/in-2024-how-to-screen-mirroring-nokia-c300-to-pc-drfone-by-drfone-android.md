So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Nokia C300 deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Nokia C300 deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Nokia C300 deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Nokia C300 devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Nokia C300 device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!

### What is the Disadvantage of Screen Casting?

Screen casting, as a process, is not better than screen mirroring. Essentially, this process does not allow you to use the mobile when it is connected to the computer. If you have connected your Android to the PC through screencasting, you will have to disconnect it to use the mobile phone.
