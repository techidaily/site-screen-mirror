| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Xiaomi Redmi 13C devices, saving you extra costs. |

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Xiaomi Redmi 13C  Phone to  Xiaomi TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Xiaomi Redmi 13C  devices that allows you to **screen share on Xiaomi Redmi 13C ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Xiaomi Redmi 13C  device to your  Xiaomi TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Xiaomi Redmi 13C  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.
