So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Google Pixel Fold deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Google Pixel Fold deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Google Pixel Fold devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Google Pixel Fold device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!
