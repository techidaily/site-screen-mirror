## Part 4: Screen Mirroring Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G to PC Wirelessly – Vysor

Vysor has presented itself as a very strong screen mirroring application for Android phones such as Xiaomi. It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone's battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G to your PC.
