## Part 6: Screen Recording and Mirror (FREE)

Another screen mirroring platform that we can take into notice is the free Mirror Samsung Galaxy S23 Chrome application. AllCast provides you with an explicit solution for mirroring the contents from your Android Phone onto a screen that can either be your PC, another phone, or a videogame console.

The application provides a vibrant feature set with the option of audio and video support during live streaming, along with the characteristics of photo sharing and screen sharing.
