### MomoCast

If you look for mirroring your Apple iPhone 13 Pro's or iPad's screen while operating a video from a webpage, MomoCast can prove to be very influential and supportive in casting the Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Chromecast. You can play videos on the webpage of the TV using MomoCast or mirror the webpage opened from Apple iPhone 13 Pro to the TV with the help of Chromecast. However, it is to be kept in mind that MomoCast operates with its extension within the Safari webpage, which can then be used for sending information to the TV with the help of streaming devices. The only device that is compatible with MomoCast is Chromecast, for now. It is available on the Internet for free. Though this application might seem quite straightforward in use, it provides impeccable services and results to the users, which is highly preferred.

**Pros:**

- It is a perfect platform that connects with Chromecast without a slight issue.
- It provides an effective remedy from avoiding using different browsers that might affect the quality.

**Cons:**

- There are not a lot of features as in different screen mirroring applications.

If you look forward to using MomoCast as a featured application for screencasting Apple iPhone 13 Pro to Chromecast, you need to follow the step-by-step guide as provided below.

**Step 1:** Install the application on the iPhone and check whether the Apple iPhone 13 Pro devices are connected over the same Wi-Fi.

**Step 2:** Open up the Safari browser, tap on the "Share" button, and select the option of "Cast with MomoCast."
