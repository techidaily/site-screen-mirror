**Step 1: Connect HDMI cable to the TV**

You need to attach an HDMI cable from the back of the TV after turning it on. Have the HDMI cable connected to the Lightning Digital AV Adapter.

**Step 2: Connect your Phone**

After connecting your AV adapter, connect its end to the iPhone and access the HDMI option from the ‚ÄòInput‚Äô section of your Samsung TV. This would simply mirror your Apple iPhone XS to Samsung TV.
