**Step 3: Run Scrcpy File**

After enabling the USB Debugging mode, you need to re-launch the .exe file on your computer and allow all the prompt messages received on your phone. This will conclusively mirror your Oppo F25 Pro 5G screen to PC without any discrepancies. However, it should be kept in mind that the process elapses as soon as you detach your phone from the USB connection.

## Part 4: Screen Mirroring Oppo F25 Pro 5G to PC Wirelessly – Vysor

Vysor has presented itself as a very strong screen mirroring application for Android phones such as Xiaomi. It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Oppo F25 Pro 5G to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone's battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Oppo F25 Pro 5G to your PC.

**Step 1: Initiate USB Debugging on your Phone**

You need to have USB debugging enabled on your phone to connect your Oppo F25 Pro 5G through the ADB connection. If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.

**Step 2: Open Command Prompt on PC**

Turn on the Command Prompt on your PC to initiate an ADB command terminal. For that, you need to type in ‘adb tcpip 5556’ to restart ADB in TCPIP mode.

![type-the-command](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-1.jpg)

**Step 3: Locate your IP Address**

Following this, you need to locate the IP address of your Xiaomi. If you have a phone with an OS version below 6.0, type in:

Adb shell

Netcfg

Conversely, for phones greater than Android 7, sulk in:

Adb shell

ifconfig

A list shall appear on the Command Prompt, showing a list of all the local IP addresses associated with the computer. You need to locate the IP address of your Oppo F25 Pro 5G Android phone and have it copied on the clipboard.

**Step 4: Close and Re-Type IP Address**

You need to exit the ADB window to re-type the IP address for connecting your PC with the phone. Type ‘ADB shell’ to exit the window; however, keep the terminal open. Retype the IP address on the screen.

![retype-your-ip-address](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-2.jpg)

**Step 5: Remove USB Cable and Confirm Connection**

Following this, you need to remove the USB cable and continue using your phone using the ADB connection through the Wi-Fi and Hotspot connection of your phone. To confirm, you can check the Oppo F25 Pro 5G device connected through Vysor to observe it active on the list. You can simply connect to the phone in a normal manner for screen mirroring Oppo F25 Pro 5G to PC.
