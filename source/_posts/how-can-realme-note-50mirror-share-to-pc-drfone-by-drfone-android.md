At the same time, screen mirroring can be done when one device continuously sends the copy of its screen to another targeted device simultaneously.

In a meeting or presentation, screen mirroring plays an important role by facilitating team members to avoid complex setups and share their screens immediately. Moreover, screen mirroring supports the BYOD model, that is, "Bring Your Own Device." The reason for supporting this model is to lower the cost and increase efficiency.
