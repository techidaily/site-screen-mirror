## Part 2. How to Mirror Android Phone to Android Tablet

Innovations in technology have allowed some of the things that were at one point, not thought of. One of the amazing developments recently has been the ability to mirror one smart device to another to another smart device. This has made it possible to mirror android to android. Mirroring android to android is the end of the innovation, the innovation even includes the possibility to mirror TVs by a smartphone or even your laptop and operate it with your phone as a remote. The experience is unlimited and includes sharing and playing your Android smartphone content to your tablet and even exporting content from your smartphone to your tablet. Android to Android mirroring is amazing, and you just might want to try it out. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even mobile hotspots.

While there are many tools for android to android mirroring, this example will use ScreenShare, which uses ScreenShare Technology to allow two android to android mirror through Bluetooth, mobile hotspots, or Wi-Fi. This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets.

**Requirements**

- • A tablet running Android 2.3+
- • A smartphone running Android 2.3+

After the above steps have been done successfully, your devices will have been mirrored successfully, and you can now start to enjoy the experience that comes with it. For connection through Wi-Fi for the two android devices. Take note of the above steps;

•Connect the two devices that you want to mirror to the same Wi-Fi network

•You can also connect your tablet to your phone's mobile hotspot if you are traveling, on Screen service for both the Realme C67 5G devices you want to mirror, set wireless network like Wi-Fi, on the tablet service screen, select your phone name to start the connection, then complete the process by confirming on your phone.
