### 1) Double Twist

We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.

### 2) iMediaShare Lite

This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.

However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg)

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.

Mirroring Android Devices has been made easier with a very definitive and expansive device of AllCast where you can share your Vivo Y78 5Gscreen to PC by following a few steps, as stated below.

**Step 1: Download Applications on both devices**

You need to have the AllCast application on both your PC and Vivo Y78 5Gphones for connecting them, and mirrors share your screen to the PC.

**Step 2: Open Computer Receiver**

After ensuring that the PC, as well as the mobile phone, are connected over the same Wi-Fi device, you need to initiate the process by opening the AllCast Receiver through the Chrome Application Launcher.

**Step 3: Initiate Mirror Share**

After getting the appropriate settings on the computer, you need to propagate towards the phone. Initiate ‘Screen Recording and Mirror’ on the Vivo Y78 5G.

**Step 4: Synchronize Devices**

In the options presented by "Screen Recording and Mirror," you need to access the "Network Devices" and select the appropriate desktop model. Selecting the model will start screen sharing with 'Chrome @' followed by the IP Address of the computer. This allows you to mirror your Vivo Y78 5Gscreen to PC wirelessly through AllCast without difficulty.
