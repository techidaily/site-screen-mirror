### Key Features Provided by the Online Screen Mirroring Solution

There are some prominent features of this online mirroring solution that makes it a special choice in the market. Let's find out more about these features below:

- You are not required to use a Bluetooth or NFC connection for mirroring the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G device.
- The tool is completely free and does not have any ads associated with it.
- You can adjust the mirrored screen by zooming, rotating, or taking screenshots.

### What is the Disadvantage of Screen Casting?

Screen casting, as a process, is not better than screen mirroring. Essentially, this process does not allow you to use the mobile when it is connected to the computer. If you have connected your Android to the PC through screencasting, you will have to disconnect it to use the mobile phone.
