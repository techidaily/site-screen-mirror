## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror Nokia C32 to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror Nokia C32 to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| **Cons of Using USB Connection** | **Pros of Using Wireless Connection** |
| --- | --- |
| The wire that you might be used to establish the USB connection would be damaged, which is causing issues in attaching the Nokia C32 devices. | There are no threats of damaging any wire, which will disrupt the connection. |
| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Nokia C32 device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Nokia C32 device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Nokia C32 devices, saving you extra costs. |

### Conclusion

This article has provided an overview of the best methods available to **mirror Nokia C32 to Mac** properly. As you have had the option of mirroring the Nokia C32 devices through USB and wireless connections, it gives you clarity in selecting the best one. Tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone Air offers some exquisite experiences in mirroring screens for free, making it one of the best in the market.
