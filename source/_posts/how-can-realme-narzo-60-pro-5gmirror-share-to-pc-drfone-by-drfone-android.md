**Step 2:** In this step, you need to download ApowerMirror on your PC and install its setup. Now open the app from the Desktop.

**Step 3:** Now, use a USB cable to connect your Android device with your PC. After that, check the notification that appears on your Android device. Begin the mirroring process by clicking on the "Start Now" option in that notification.

## Final Words

This article covers everything about screen mirroring and its working with the need to cast Android screen to PC. We have discussed the concept of screen mirroring both by wired or wireless connection. With the help of this article, you can now share your Android screen on a laptop or PC and can share data like documents, images, games, etc.

Furthermore, Wondershare introduces us to software like MirrorGo. It helps us to build a wireless connection between devices that we want to connect for screen mirroring purposes.
