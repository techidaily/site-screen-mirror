### 3\. LetsView - All Platform Compatible Screening for Android

If you seek a better option in the market for screen mirroring your Android device, LetsView provides a diversely compatible system that can easily help you execute the process.

I don't have interference between my mobile & Wi-Fi adapter. If it wasn't for the lag, I'd give this 5 stars. The only fix I see is lowering the res, but I actually need HD. Lowering it would defeat my purpose."
