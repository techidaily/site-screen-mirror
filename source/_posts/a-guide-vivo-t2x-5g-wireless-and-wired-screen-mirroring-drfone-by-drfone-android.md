## Part 1: Why Need Screen Mirroring?

If we consider the traditional and conventional methods of connecting AV cables, HDMI's, or VGA adapters for connecting smaller screened devices to larger screens, these methods present too much work and a series of protocols that potentially outdated the system completely. In the environment that we survive in, it is significant for us to understand that presenters keep their data intact on their smartphones and have it efficiently shared among his colleagues before the discussion. The wireless screen technology enables presenters to pose such a system into power, which not only increases the mobility but the efficiency of the system too without any unnecessary delays in connecting the Vivo T2x 5G device with a larger platform. Screen mirroring can be set as the most optimal solution to such issues, which would not only allow you to enjoy presenting but save a lot of effort before developing the frame of presentation.
