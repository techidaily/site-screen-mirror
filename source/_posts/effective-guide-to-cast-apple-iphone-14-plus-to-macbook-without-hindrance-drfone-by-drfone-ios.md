## Part 2. Mirror PC to Apple iPhone 14 Plus – The Process to use VNC viewer to Mirror PC to Apple iPhone 14 Plus

Mirroring is simply the method to share the screen of one device on another. You can use your computer to mirror the screen on any other device such as the iPhone. It can also be done on other platforms such as Android and macOS.

As stated earlier, third-party apps allow the user to access and control the PC remotely through the iPhone. The VNC viewer is one of the most versatile apps for sharing the PC screen to the iPhone, which offers 256-bit AES encryption for a secure mirroring experience.

The service supports the top operating systems for computers and smartphones, such as iOS, macOS, Chrome, Linux, and Android. The one major drawback of using the VNC viewer is that the image or display quality is not up to the mark.

The method to use the VNC viewer is stated below:

- The first thing that you need to do is install the VNC viewer on both your computer and iPhone;
- Launch the VNC app on your PC and provide your login credentials to sign-in to your VNC account;
- You would also need to install the VNC server separately, which is necessary if you wish to control the PC from iPhone;
- Run the VNC viewer on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and enter your login credentials. You will be able to see your PC’s name after from the VNC Viewer app on your phone;
- Start the identification by selecting the PC from the app and tap on Continue;
- You will notice that the PC screen will appear on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. It will also allow you to control the contents of the computer remotely.
