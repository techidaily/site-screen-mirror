## Part 1: Why should we consider using screen mirroring?

Screen mirroring has extensive utility if considered. However, the major factor that should be considered is its ability to control the discipline of the room where it is to be shared.

If we look over the environment of an office, we will save the inadequacies involved in sharing the content with the people present during a presentation without explanation.
