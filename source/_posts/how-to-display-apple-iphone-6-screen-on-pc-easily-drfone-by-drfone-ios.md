## Part 1: Why should we consider using screen mirroring?

Screen mirroring has extensive utility if considered. However, the major factor that should be considered is its ability to control the discipline of the room where it is to be shared. Except for looking onto a single Apple iPhone 6 screen, it would be better if a similar screen is being mirrored to a larger screen, such as a laptop that is visible to everyone present in the room while maintaining the decorum of the room. If we look over the environment of an office, we will save the inadequacies involved in sharing the content with the people present during a presentation without explanation. Conversely, if we take the example of a classroom in a school, mirroring the Apple iPhone 6 screen to Mac saves a lot of disciplinary issues and would keep all the attendants in the class intact to their positions.
