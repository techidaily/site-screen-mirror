## Part 2: Why should you use screen mirroring?

Before discovering the applications and their guides on how to effectively utilize them for screen mirroring Apple iPhone 12 Pro to iPad, it is important for many of the people to understand the significance of screen mirroring your devices onto bigger screens. There can be many reasons for why screen mirroring is preferred in comparison to other extravagant options.

If we take the environment of an office into consideration, we can clearly demonstrate the use of screen mirroring during a meeting. At an instant, where a meeting attendee feels to add a positive contribution that he discovered on his/her iPhone, it might get extremely hard to get it circulated amongst all members. For that, he/she has to get up from their position and circle around the room, showing it to everyone sitting in the meeting. This demonstrates the decorum of the meeting, leaving the people present in the room in a very awkward and inconvenient situation. For this, you can utilize the screen mirroring feature present on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to professionally manage the situation and have your message circulated across all members of the meeting without any hiatus in the decorum of the meeting. This analogy can be implied across a school, where you need to keep a progressive environment without any disruption. For this, you need to focus on using screen mirroring applications for efficiently covering all your demands. This, however, can be covered out using a third-party screen mirroring application.

## Part 1: Cast Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Mac via AirPlay \[Best Choice\]

AirPlay is the dedicated technique available to cast the iPhone onto a Mac. While this is the direct option Apple provides for its devices, it is pretty simple to cover. You need to process a few basic steps to **cast to MacBook** with the help of this functionality. However, there are multiple drawbacks to using AirPlay in casting devices, which shall be discussed later.

Before that, let's look into how you can cast your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Mac using AirPlay:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, you will have to connect the iPhone and the Mac to the same Wi-Fi network. Afterward, access the "Control Center" of your Apple iPhone 12 Pro. For iPhone X and later models, you have to swipe from the top-right corner, while for iPhone 8 or earlier models, the Control Center can be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

**Step 2:** Select "Screen Mirroring" from the available options and hold the particular button.

**Step 3:** You will be led to a new screen where you must discover your Mac device and select it. For a successful connection, you might need to add the AirPlay code provided on the screen of your Mac.

![choose your macbook](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-cast-iphone-to-mac-3.jpg)

**Supported Devices:** iPhone with iOS 12.3 or later; Mac with macOS Mojave or later.

**Pros**

- The process of casting devices through AirPlay is quite simple.
- You are not required to download any application for this method.

**Con**

- You are not allowed to control your device on the Mac.

## Part 2: Why Can't I AirPlay My Apple iPhone 12 Pro to My MacBook?

There is a major problem with using AirPlay to connect the Apple iPhone 12 Pro to the MacBook. If you cannot cast your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Mac using AirPlay, there can be multiple problems leading to this. To know more about these problems, let's look ahead to figure out which one of the issues might be causing issues for you while **casting from Apple iPhone 12 Pro to MacBook:**

- It is possible that the Apple iPhone 12 Pro devices in use for screencasting are not compatible. For that, you must check the Apple iPhone 12 Pro devices to figure out if they are compatible and supports AirPlay.
- As the connection is established through a Wi-Fi network, you must check whether the Apple iPhone 12 Pro devices are connected to the same network. In other cases, it is also possible that the Wi-Fi connection is not strong enough.
- Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro or Mac can cause issues with connectivity through AirPlay if they are not updated to the latest version.
- It is possible that the AirPlay connectivity is hindered between iPhone and Mac due to Firewall Settings. Therefore, you will have to disable and allow some settings for that purpose.
