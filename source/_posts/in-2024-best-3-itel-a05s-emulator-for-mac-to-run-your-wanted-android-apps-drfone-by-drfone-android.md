Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing.

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Itel A05s  devices that allows you to **screen share on Itel A05s ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
