![stream iphone to computer 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-02.jpg)

You should follow the steps below to do that.

**Step 1:** You need to download and install the app on your smartphone. To do that, go to your app store and search AirbeamTV. Once you locate the app, you will opt for the Mirroring to the Mac option. Download the app and install it. Afterward, go to your PC to download the Chrome browser if you don’t have one yet.

**Step 2:** Now, return to your smartphone and go to Mirror Mac PC. The moment you open it, a code will pop up. Ensure that your laptop has the same network provider as Your Apple iPhone X. Well, the reason is to get a seamless connection.

**Step 3:** Return to your Chrome browser and type: Start.airbeam.tv. The moment you do that, the code on your mobile device appears on the browser. Then click on Connect. Once you look at your smartphone, you will see a notification telling you that you are connected to the Mac operating system.

**Step 4:** Click on Start Mirroring and then Start Broadcast. At this point, your handheld device automatically connects to your browser. Everything that happens on your phone screen is shown in the Chrome browser. You can then share it with any video-conferencing tool of your choice.

## AirServer

You can also connect your iOS devices to your laptop using AirServer.

![stream iphone to computer 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-03.jpg)

As always, ensure that laptops and iDevice use the same WiFi network. If you have iOS 11 or the newer version, you should follow these steps.

**Step 1:** Once your iDevice is connected to your laptop, head to the bottom of the screen to access the Control Center. You can access the Control Center on any iPhone by swiping down the top right corner of the screen.

**Step 2:** Connect your Phone: Now, tap the Screen Mirroring icon on your handheld device. Once you do that, your network will begin to display the list of AirPlay-enabled receivers.

If you do not see the AirPlay icon, you have to troubleshoot your PC. At this juncture, you will see your phone screen displayed on your laptop.

Note that this works for iOS 8 and newer versions. Interestingly, you just need to follow the same steps to do it. Regardless of the iOS version, it is fast and easy.

## 5kPlayer

**Step 1:** Launch 5KPlayer on your computer and then click on the AirPlay icon to turn it on.

**Step 2:** Make your way to your Apple iPhone X’s Control Center by swiping down on it.

**Step 3:** At this point, you have to tap on the Screen/AirPlay Mirroring. When the Apple iPhone X device list pops up, you should choose your computer. At this juncture, you have accomplished your task because your phone screen will appear on your desktop. You can stream now!

1\. Ensure that you have correctly installed the Roku app on your Apple iPhone X or iPad. You can get it from [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roku/id482066631?mt=8).

2\. Once the installation process is complete, launch the app on your device.

## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone X to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone X device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone X or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!
