## How to Stream Apple iPhone 7 Video to Computer?

The world has progressed with the introduction to smartphones, where major features are being infused on a daily basis that are making the technology decrease in size and increase in the application. Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone 7 video to a computer.


## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 7 video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 7 across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 7 onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 7 has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 7 to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.
