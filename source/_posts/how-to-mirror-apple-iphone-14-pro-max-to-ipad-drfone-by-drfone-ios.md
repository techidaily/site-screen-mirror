With the innovative screencasting solution, you can stream your smartphone to a computer. Just as the methods above, this method is easy. That said, follow the steps below to use it.

**Step 3:** At this point, you have completed the task. All you have to do is start mirroring and exploring the content of your cellphone on your desktop.

Once you have established the connection, you can also control your cellphone from the same computer. To do that, you need to get a mouse or use your trackpad. When you get to Step 3 above, activate your phone’s AssisiveTouch and pair it with your system’s Bluetooth. Now, that’s all there is to it!

## Conclusion

From the onset, we promised to simplify the steps, and we did. The thing is, you can choose any of the four options outlined above to stream your iDevices to your desktop. Note that the AirbeamTV option does not necessarily have to be a Mac OS. Given that Chrome runs on all platforms, you can use both Windows and Mac systems. All you need to do is install the Chrome browser and start streaming your cellphone to your PC. In other words, you do not need cables to stream your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to your PC because this process is wireless.

Remember, it runs on a WiFi connection. Once you have done it, you can have a better view of your cellphone and share certain activities on Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max with everyone in the room. It can do it during your board meeting or at home. For instance, you may further project to a screen, allowing more people in the office to watch you, as you demonstrate stuff from Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. This, in turn, improves workflow, culminates in improved collaboration, and less time-wasting. Now, it is time to return to the steps and give it a shot.
