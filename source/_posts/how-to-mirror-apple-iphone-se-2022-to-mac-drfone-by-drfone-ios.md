## How Can I Screen Mirroring Apple iPhone SE (2022) to TV/Laptop?

Apple has introduced a very smart feature within its devices that make them more cognitive and intuitive to device connectivity. Screen mirroring has been considered a very important and professional feature that helps you save a lot of fuss while sharing content with your colleagues or family. If you wish to show an important article or a video during an office presentation that would change the dynamics of the discussion, Apple presents its screen mirroring features operated through third-party screen mirroring applications that would allow you to share the small screen onto a larger screen.

Before understanding the procedures of how we can execute the screen mirroring on iPhone X, it is significant for us to understand what Apple iPhone SE (2022) really believes screen mirroring to be. Apple iPhone SE (2022) introduced a very explicit feature under the domain of screen mirror functionality, which has provided improved results when screened on PC or Mac.

Apple provided its users with a very straightforward mechanism to follow for enabling the screen mirroring function on iPhone X.

While believing that there are multiple approaches that can be adapted for screen mirroring Apple iPhone SE (2022) to Samsung TV, it is significant to navigate to the most appropriate version of the screen mirroring your Apple iPhone SE (2022) X. The following methods describe the most effective and efficient approaches that can easily mirror Apple iPhone SE (2022) onto Samsung TV.

### Through AirPlay 2

AirPlay 2 has been Apple's highlight in enabling screen mirroring and helping people discover pertinent ways to share their iPhone's or iPad's screen onto larger screens.

For understanding the procedure of connecting your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to Samsung TV with the help of AirPlay 2, you need to follow the steps provided below.

**Step 1: Ensuring Internet Connection**

You need to ensure that the network connection connecting your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and Samsung TV is similar. It is considered as an important factor in screen mirroring iPhone X.

**Step 2: Access the Media File**

Following this, you need to open the media file that you seek to mirror onto the Samsung TV. You need to open the Photos application on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) to access the image or video that you seek to share.

**Step 3: Share the Media File**

After locating the file, you need to choose the file and tap on the 'Share' icon present on the bottom left of the screen. Select the "Airplay" icon from the link to open up a new window on the front.

For understanding the procedure of connecting your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to Samsung TV using a digital AV adapter, you need to look over the step-by-step guide provided below.

**Step 1: Connect HDMI cable to the TV**

You need to attach an HDMI cable from the back of the TV after turning it on. Have the HDMI cable connected to the Lightning Digital AV Adapter.

**Step 2: Connect your Phone**

After connecting your AV adapter, connect its end to the iPhone and access the HDMI option from the ‘Input’ section of your Samsung TV. This would simply mirror your Apple iPhone SE (2022) to Samsung TV.
