## Part 1: Cast Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Mac via AirPlay \[Best Choice\]

AirPlay is the dedicated technique available to cast the iPhone onto a Mac. While this is the direct option Apple provides for its devices, it is pretty simple to cover. You need to process a few basic steps to **cast to MacBook** with the help of this functionality. However, there are multiple drawbacks to using AirPlay in casting devices, which shall be discussed later.

Before that, let's look into how you can cast your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Mac using AirPlay:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, you will have to connect the iPhone and the Mac to the same Wi-Fi network. Afterward, access the "Control Center" of your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. For iPhone X and later models, you have to swipe from the top-right corner, while for iPhone 8 or earlier models, the Control Center can be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

**Step 2:** Select "Screen Mirroring" from the available options and hold the particular button.

**Step 3:** You will be led to a new screen where you must discover your Mac device and select it. For a successful connection, you might need to add the AirPlay code provided on the screen of your Mac.

![choose your macbook](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-cast-iphone-to-mac-3.jpg)

**Supported Devices:** iPhone with iOS 12.3 or later; Mac with macOS Mojave or later.

**Pros**

- You are not required to download any application for this method.

**Con**

## Part 2: Why Can't I AirPlay My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to My MacBook?

There is a major problem with using AirPlay to connect the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to the MacBook. If you cannot cast your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to Mac using AirPlay, there can be multiple problems leading to this. To know more about these problems, let's look ahead to figure out which one of the issues might be causing issues for you while **casting from Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max to MacBook:**

- It is possible that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max devices in use for screencasting are not compatible. For that, you must check the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max devices to figure out if they are compatible and supports AirPlay.
- As the connection is established through a Wi-Fi network, you must check whether the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max devices are connected to the same network. In other cases, it is also possible that the Wi-Fi connection is not strong enough.
- Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or Mac can cause issues with connectivity through AirPlay if they are not updated to the latest version.
