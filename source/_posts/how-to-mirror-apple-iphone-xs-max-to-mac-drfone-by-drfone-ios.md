## Part 1: Why should we consider using screen mirroring?

Screen mirroring has extensive utility if considered. However, the major factor that should be considered is its ability to control the discipline of the room where it is to be shared.

If we look over the environment of an office, we will save the inadequacies involved in sharing the content with the people present during a presentation without explanation. Conversely, if we take the example of a classroom in a school, mirroring the Apple iPhone XS Max screen to Mac saves a lot of disciplinary issues and would keep all the attendants in the class intact to their positions.

With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone XS Max to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device.
