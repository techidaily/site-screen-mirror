To understand the simple process of mirroring your Android screen across the PC, you need to follow the steps explained as follows:

**Step 1: Download, Install and Launch**

Users are requested to download the latest version of MirrorGo from their official website. Once installed, launch the application on the computer.

**Step 2: Same Internet Connection**

The user needs to ensure that the PC and Android device are connected across the same Wi-Fi connection. Once done, tap on the option of “Mirror Infinix Hot 40 Pro PC via Wi-Fi” on the lower bottom of the application’s interface.

Before that, it is important to turn on USB Debugging across the Android device for successful connection. Once the phone appears under "Select a device to connect," you can remove the Android phone from the USB connection.
