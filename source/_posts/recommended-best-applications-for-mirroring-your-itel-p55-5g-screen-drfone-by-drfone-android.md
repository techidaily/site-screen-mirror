## Part 2. How to Mirror Android Phone to Android Tablet

Innovations in technology have allowed some of the things that were at one point, not thought of. One of the amazing developments recently has been the ability to mirror one smart device to another to another smart device. This has made it possible to mirror android to android. Mirroring android to android is the end of the innovation, the innovation even includes the possibility to mirror TVs by a smartphone or even your laptop and operate it with your phone as a remote. The experience is unlimited and includes sharing and playing your Android smartphone content to your tablet and even exporting content from your smartphone to your tablet. Android to Android mirroring is amazing, and you just might want to try it out. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even mobile hotspots.

While there are many tools for android to android mirroring, this example will use ScreenShare, which uses ScreenShare Technology to allow two android to android mirror through Bluetooth, mobile hotspots, or Wi-Fi. This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets. It also uses the ScreenShare browser, ScreenShare service, and ScreenShare organizer that help manage Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection and your data exchange between your two mirrored devices.

**Requirements**

- â€¢ A tablet running Android 2.3+
- â€¢ A smartphone running Android 2.3+

## Part 3. How to install ScreenShare Applications

Installing the browser on your android devices that you want to mirror.

- â€¢ On Google Play Store, search for ScreenShare using your device, then select the ScreenShare (phone) app for your tablet and ScreenShare (tablet) app for your phone.
- â€¢ Install the application on both devices that you want to mirror.

After the installation is successful, it then means you can use the ScreenShare connection.

## Part 4.Android to android mirroring through Bluetooth

1\. Start your installed ScreenShare service on the two devices you want to mirror.

ScreenShare > Menu > ScreenShare service.

2\. Set your wireless network to Bluetooth on both devices that you want to mirror (this is if it is set as Wi-Fi), this can be done in the ScreenShare service home screen

![Android to android mirroring through Bluetooth](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/mirror-android-to-android-pic1.jpg)

4\. If one of the Itel P55 5G devices that you want to mirror is a tablet, start with it. Find your smartphone name in the Paired Devices list in ScreenShare service. Select your phone name, then tap OK, so that the connection starts. The connection should start from your tablet.

5\. The connection should be confirmed by tapping OK on your phone. This is an important step as it establishes a ScreenShare connection.

6\. As confirmation of the establishment of the ScreenShare connection, an icon will display on the status bar. Also, a "Connected" status should appear for your other device in the paired Devices list. In the circumstance that you fail to connect the first time, you will be required to wait for at least 10 to 20 seconds, after which you will have to try step 4 and 5.
