1\. You would need to connect the Android phone to the computer via USB cable to initiate the procedure;

2\. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;

3\. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;

4\. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;
