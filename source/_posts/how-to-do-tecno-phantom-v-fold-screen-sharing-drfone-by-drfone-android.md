## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Tecno Phantom V Fold  Phone to  Tecno TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Tecno Phantom V Fold  devices that allows you to **screen share on Tecno Phantom V Fold ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Tecno Phantom V Fold  device to your  Tecno TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Tecno Phantom V Fold  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Tecno Phantom V Fold  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Tecno Phantom V Fold  users to share their device's screen with  Tecno TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Tecno TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.
