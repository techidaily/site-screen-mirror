## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Vivo Y27 5G  Phone to  Vivo TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Vivo Y27 5G  devices that allows you to **screen share on Vivo Y27 5G ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Vivo Y27 5G  device to your  Vivo TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Vivo Y27 5G  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Vivo Y27 5G  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Vivo Y27 5G  users to share their device's screen with  Vivo TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Vivo TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.
