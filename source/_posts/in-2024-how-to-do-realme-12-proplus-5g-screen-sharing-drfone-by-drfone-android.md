## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Realme 12 Pro+ 5G  Phone to  Realme TV Using Smart View?

I filled out the form declaring that my use was non-commercial, scanned it, and sent it to TeamViewer, but it made no difference. I'd be willing to pay for the personal use of the product, but it's not even an option."
