3) **Allstream:** For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers.

However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also [download music from Spotify](https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html) and enjoy it everywhere as you want.

Available for both, iOS and Android platforms, it comes with dual AirPlay-DLNA capabilities, and has the functionality which makes it compatible with numerous varieties of TVs and streaming boxes, without having the users to worry about the transmission standards. Xbox 360, Apple TV, is among the few of these.
