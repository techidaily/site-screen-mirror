### Screen Casting vs. Screen Mirroring: What's the Difference?

You might have heard of screencasting and screen mirroring together many times. It may come as a surprise to you that these two terminologies hold considerable differences from each other. To simplify the difference, screencasting is performed with the motive of displaying the content of the screen on another output display in the same room.

## How To Do Honor Play 40C  Screen Sharing

[![](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Smartphones by Honor Play 40C  are rich in functionality and offer multiple benefits to users. However, do we ever wonder about using **screen share in Honor Play 40C ?**

Whether there is a need to show unique clicks or videos on a bigger screen or want to stream amazing content on big TVs or computers, we must know **how to screen share on a Honor Play 40C  phone.** It becomes a lot easier to cater to a big audience with big screens.

So today, let us go through a detailed guide on **how to screen share in Honor Play 40C ** to smart TVs and computers.

![samsung devices featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Honor Play 40C  Phone to  Honor TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Honor Play 40C  devices that allows you to **screen share on Honor Play 40C ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Honor Play 40C  device to your  Honor TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Honor Play 40C  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.
