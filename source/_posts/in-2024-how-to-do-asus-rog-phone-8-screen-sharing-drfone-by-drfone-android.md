## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Asus ROG Phone 8  Phone to  Asus TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Asus ROG Phone 8  devices that allows you to **screen share on Asus ROG Phone 8 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
