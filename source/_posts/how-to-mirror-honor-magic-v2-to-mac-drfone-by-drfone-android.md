## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror Honor Magic V2 to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror Honor Magic V2 to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| **Cons of Using USB Connection** | **Pros of Using Wireless Connection** |
| --- | --- |
| The wire that you might be used to establish the USB connection would be damaged, which is causing issues in attaching the Honor Magic V2 devices. | There are no threats of damaging any wire, which will disrupt the connection. |
| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Honor Magic V2 device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Honor Magic V2 device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Honor Magic V2 devices, saving you extra costs. |

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Honor TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

Before explaining the steps, it is important to state that available screens and settings may change depending on your device, Smart TV, or service provider. The Smart View feature is also unavailable on all Samsung devices, and you might need to use the Smart View or Smart Things app.

Ensure that your Samsung device and Smart TV are connected to the same network, and follow these steps for screen sharing:

**Step 1:** After connecting your device and Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network, open the "Quick Panel" on your Samsung device. Here, press and enable "Smart View."

**Step 2:** Select your  Honor TV among the available devices when Smart View is enabled. Once connected, choose the content you want to share on the TV screen.

![enable the smart view feature](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** You can select your desired content through options like My Photos, My Videos, or My Music. When the desired content is selected, you can enjoy it on a bigger screen.

## Part 3: How to Share Screen From Samsung Phones to Other Smart TVs?

If your Smart TV is of another brand instead of Samsung, it is still possible to share the Samsung devices screen with your TV. Multiple tools are available online that can be used to share your Samsung device with your TV, depending on the TV brand. You can use tools like AllShare Cast, Chromecast, or Amazon Firestick.

Like Smart View, all wireless screen share tools require your Samsung device and Smart TV to be connected to the same network. Once connected, you will need to plug the respective tool's adapter into your Smart TV, and you should be able to share your Samsung device. If your Smart TV doesn't support Miracast, you can use AllShare Cast Wireless Hub for screen sharing.
