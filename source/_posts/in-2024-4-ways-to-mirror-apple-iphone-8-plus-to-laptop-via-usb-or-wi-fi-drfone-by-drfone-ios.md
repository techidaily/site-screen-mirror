## Part 1. What Is Screen Mirroring?

To understand what screen mirroring is, it is important to know what it is not. So, screen mirroring is neither sharing software nor media streaming nor does it involve the use of physical connectors such as HDMI or various other cables.

It is a wireless mirroring of data from a screen-sending device to a screen-receiving device. Users who have screens mirrored can access files, control mobile notifications, manage applications, take screenshots, stream movies, and more while controlling their iPhones. Some methods of screen mirroring can also enable reverse control.

Screen mirroring can work with the presence of a local Wi-Fi network, or without one – but a USB in that case is essential. Ideally, either device should be in the same room. The terminology of screen mirroring cannot be explained in simpler words. Therefore, we will next look at how screen mirroring works.

## Part 2. How Does Screen Mirroring Work?

As mentioned earlier, there needs to be a receiver and a sender for screen mirroring to work. Besides, there are also a few screens mirroring protocols to follow, such as the presence of hardware or software receivers on the receiving devices.

An example of a hardware receiver is an Apple TV, Chromecast, and many others. A software receiver is a device that uses a software application like Reflector to turn an existing device into a screen-receiver – as applicable on Mac or Windows computers.

There are several ways to establish connections for screen mirroring. Devices that are not compatible with the mirroring wirelessly can create technological barriers for bigger settings. Fortunately, there are third-party solutions that can bridge the gap and enable compatible devices to mirror screens.

## Part 2. Mirror PC to Apple iPhone 8 Plus – The Process to use VNC viewer to Mirror PC to Apple iPhone 8 Plus

Mirroring is simply the method to share the screen of one device on another. You can use your computer to mirror the screen on any other device such as the iPhone. It can also be done on other platforms such as Android and macOS.

As stated earlier, third-party apps allow the user to access and control the PC remotely through the iPhone. The VNC viewer is one of the most versatile apps for sharing the PC screen to the iPhone, which offers 256-bit AES encryption for a secure mirroring experience.

The service supports the top operating systems for computers and smartphones, such as iOS, macOS, Chrome, Linux, and Android. The one major drawback of using the VNC viewer is that the image or display quality is not up to the mark.

The method to use the VNC viewer is stated below:

- The first thing that you need to do is install the VNC viewer on both your computer and iPhone;
- Launch the VNC app on your PC and provide your login credentials to sign-in to your VNC account;
- You would also need to install the VNC server separately, which is necessary if you wish to control the PC from iPhone;
- Run the VNC viewer on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and enter your login credentials. You will be able to see your PC’s name after from the VNC Viewer app on your phone;
- Start the identification by selecting the PC from the app and tap on Continue;
- You will notice that the PC screen will appear on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. It will also allow you to control the contents of the computer remotely.
