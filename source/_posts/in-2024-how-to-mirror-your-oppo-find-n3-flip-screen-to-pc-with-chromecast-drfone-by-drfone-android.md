### 1) Double Twist

We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.

### 2) iMediaShare Lite

This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.

### 4) AllShare

For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn't come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Oppo Find N3 Flip device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg)

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.
