## How to Stream Apple iPhone 14 Video to Computer?

The world has progressed with the introduction to smartphones, where major features are being infused on a daily basis that are making the technology decrease in size and increase in the application. Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone 14 video to a computer.


## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 14 video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 14 across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 14 onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 14 has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 14 to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.

## Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone 14 video to PC with VLC Streamer

There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone 14 videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around. VLC Streamer is a perfect platform that offers you to stream videos over an Apple iPhone 14 through a PC. The process for executing this feature is quite simple and straightforward. To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.

**Step 1:** You need to download the VLC streamer across your Apple iPhone 14 and PC simultaneously. Search through the App Store and download its free version across your Apple iPhone 14.

**Step 3:** At this point, you have completed the task. All you have to do is start mirroring and exploring the content of your cellphone on your desktop.

Once you have established the connection, you can also control your cellphone from the same computer. To do that, you need to get a mouse or use your trackpad. When you get to Step 3 above, activate your phone’s AssisiveTouch and pair it with your system’s Bluetooth. Now, that’s all there is to it!

## Conclusion

From the onset, we promised to simplify the steps, and we did. The thing is, you can choose any of the four options outlined above to stream your iDevices to your desktop. Note that the AirbeamTV option does not necessarily have to be a Mac OS. Given that Chrome runs on all platforms, you can use both Windows and Mac systems. All you need to do is install the Chrome browser and start streaming your cellphone to your PC. In other words, you do not need cables to stream your Apple iPhone 14 to your PC because this process is wireless.

Remember, it runs on a WiFi connection. Once you have done it, you can have a better view of your cellphone and share certain activities on Your Apple iPhone 14 with everyone in the room. It can do it during your board meeting or at home. For instance, you may further project to a screen, allowing more people in the office to watch you, as you demonstrate stuff from Your Apple iPhone 14. This, in turn, improves workflow, culminates in improved collaboration, and less time-wasting. Now, it is time to return to the steps and give it a shot.
