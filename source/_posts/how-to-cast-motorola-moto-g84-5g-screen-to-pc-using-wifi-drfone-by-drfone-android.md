## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Motorola Moto G84 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Motorola Moto G84 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Motorola Moto G84 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Motorola Moto G84 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Motorola Moto G84 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!

## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror Motorola Moto G84 5G to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror Motorola Moto G84 5G to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| **Cons of Using USB Connection** | **Pros of Using Wireless Connection** |
| --- | --- |
| The wire that you might be used to establish the USB connection would be damaged, which is causing issues in attaching the Motorola Moto G84 5G devices. | There are no threats of damaging any wire, which will disrupt the connection. |
| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Motorola Moto G84 5G device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Motorola Moto G84 5G device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Motorola Moto G84 5G devices, saving you extra costs. |

## Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Motorola Moto G84 5G for Streaming

AirPlay has changed the way people stream their music and other media content over several devices over a common wireless network. With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.

Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.

### 1) Double Twist

We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.

### 2) iMediaShare Lite

This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.

### 3) Twonky Beam

Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.

### 4) AllShare

For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn't come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Motorola Moto G84 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 5) Android HiFi and AirBubble

There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.

### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg)

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

### 9) Using the DS Video

One can also use DS Video to stream their video collection on to the Disk Station to their Amazon Phone or tablet. Browsing is made relatively easy as each of them is sorted into different libraries. Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.

### 10) AirStream

Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices. However, before you go on to install this app; we must notice that it is necessary for you to root your device. Alongside this, there is a short payment that must be made to enjoy all its features. Otherwise, it is a great app to have.
