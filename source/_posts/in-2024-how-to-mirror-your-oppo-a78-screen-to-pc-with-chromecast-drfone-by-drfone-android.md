You need to have USB debugging enabled on your phone to connect your Oppo A78 through the ADB connection. If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.

**Step 2: Open Command Prompt on PC**

**Step 3: Locate your IP Address**

Following this, you need to locate the IP address of your Xiaomi. If you have a phone with an OS version below 6.0, type in:

Adb shell

Netcfg

Conversely, for phones greater than Android 7, sulk in:

Adb shell

ifconfig

A list shall appear on the Command Prompt, showing a list of all the local IP addresses associated with the computer. You need to locate the IP address of your Oppo A78 Android phone and have it copied on the clipboard.

**Step 4: Close and Re-Type IP Address**

You need to exit the ADB window to re-type the IP address for connecting your PC with the phone. Type ‘ADB shell’ to exit the window; however, keep the terminal open. Retype the IP address on the screen.
