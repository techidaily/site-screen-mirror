## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Vivo TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

Ensure that your Samsung device and Smart TV are connected to the same network, and follow these steps for screen sharing:

**Step 1:** After connecting your device and Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network, open the "Quick Panel" on your Samsung device. Here, press and enable "Smart View."

**Step 2:** Select your  Vivo TV among the available devices when Smart View is enabled. Once connected, choose the content you want to share on the TV screen.
