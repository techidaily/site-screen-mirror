- To allow some of the Siri features to operate while operating AirPlay to **screen share iPhone devices,** you should get HomeKit first.
- Not all video apps or Samsung Smart TVs will work with AirPlay.

If we talk about **screen sharing Apple** Apple iPhone XR to TV or Mac through AirPlay, they have a different set of operations. Let's find out more about how to process screen sharing on these devices:

### Screen Sharing iPhone on TV

**Step 1:** To screen share your Apple iPhone XR to a TV, you must connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network. Open the video that needs to be shared on the TV.

**Step 2:** Look for the "Share" button on the video and tap the "AirPlay" option to continue connecting your Apple iPhone XR to the Apple TV. You must select your TV after tapping on the "AirPlay" option.

### Screen Sharing iPhone on Mac

## Method 2: Share Your Apple iPhone XR to a Mac via QuickTime Player

QuickTime Player is a built-in video processing tool in Mac providing unique and compelling video management services for free. This tool features some great functions, which include recording the screen and watching videos of high quality. It can also be a great utility to share the iPhone's screen with a Mac. The operation process here is relatively easy for users with macOS X Snow Leopard or macOS Mojave.

**What Are the Requirements?**

- Users must use iPhones or iPad devices with iOS 8 and Yosemite Mac OS X or above.

Let's find out how to screen share on iPhone with the help of QuickTime Player:

**Step 1:** Connect your Apple iPhone XR to the Mac with a lightning cable. Next, launch QuickTime and continue to the "File" tab on the top.

![access the file tab](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-iphone-4.jpg)

## Method 3: Share Your Apple iPhone XR Screen Over FaceTime (SharePlay)

FaceTime can be another great technique to consider screen sharing Apple iPhone with other people. If you wish to show something important to some people, you can dial them through FaceTime and share the important thing in no time. FaceTime has recently adopted the SharePlay technology to give a wholesome experience in screen sharing.

Users with iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, or later can initiate a FaceTime call with the Music or Apple TV app for sharing music or video content, respectively. Where the applications can change, the process remains the same. FaceTime is quite diverse in functionality, which involves sharing the iPhone's screen.

### What Are the Requirements?

- iPhones and iPads running on iOS/iPadOS 15.4 and above allows users to start the FaceTime call through the Apple TV app (+ other supported streaming apps) and Music app (+ other music app alternatives). Then, they can use SharePlay for video/music sharing via the call with other participants.
- To screen share Apple iPhone XR to iPhone via FaceTime, the person sharing the content and the recipient should both have iOS 15.1+ (iPhones), macOS 12.1+ (Mac), or iPadOS 15.1+ (iPads).
- Users need Apple ID to access FaceTime.

With all these provisions in mind, you must follow the steps explained below to share your Apple iPhone XR screen over FaceTime with ease:

**Step 1:** You must start a FaceTime call and connect with your respective personnel. As you connect successfully, select the "Share Content" button on the top of the screen to start screen sharing.

![tap on the share content button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-iphone-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** To establish a connection, select the "Share My Screen" button, which will initiate a countdown for sharing the screen.

![select the share my screen option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-iphone-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** To end the screen sharing, you will have to tap on the "Share Content" button again to disconnect screen sharing.

## Method 4: Share Your Apple iPhone XR Screen to a Mac or Windows PC Using a Third-Party App

If you are not satisfied with the provided methods above and intend to extend your screen sharing to Windows PC along with the Mac, you will need a third-party application to execute the process. There are multiple third-party applications existing for this purpose; however, we will help you select the best one in the options.
