## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Huawei P60  Phone to  Huawei TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Huawei P60  devices that allows you to **screen share on Huawei P60 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Huawei P60  device to your  Huawei TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Huawei P60  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App
