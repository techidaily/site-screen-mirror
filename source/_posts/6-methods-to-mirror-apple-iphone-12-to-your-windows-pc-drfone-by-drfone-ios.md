If you look for mirroring your Apple iPhone 12's or iPad's screen while operating a video from a webpage, MomoCast can prove to be very influential and supportive in casting the Apple iPhone 12 to Chromecast. You can play videos on the webpage of the TV using MomoCast or mirror the webpage opened from Apple iPhone 12 to the TV with the help of Chromecast. However, it is to be kept in mind that MomoCast operates with its extension within the Safari webpage, which can then be used for sending information to the TV with the help of streaming devices. The only device that is compatible with MomoCast is Chromecast, for now. It is available on the Internet for free. Though this application might seem quite straightforward in use, it provides impeccable services and results to the users, which is highly preferred.

**Pros:**

- It is a perfect platform that connects with Chromecast without a slight issue.
- It provides an effective remedy from avoiding using different browsers that might affect the quality.

**Cons:**

- There are not a lot of features as in different screen mirroring applications.

If you look forward to using MomoCast as a featured application for screencasting Apple iPhone 12 to Chromecast, you need to follow the step-by-step guide as provided below.

**Step 1:** Install the application on the iPhone and check whether the Apple iPhone 12 devices are connected over the same Wi-Fi.

**Step 2:** Open up the Safari browser, tap on the "Share" button, and select the option of "Cast with MomoCast."

## 3\. Top Online Apple iPhone 12 Emulators

For example, a game application developed for Android phones should be made available for smartphones running on other OS. Mobile phone emulators are therefore designed to bridge this gap. Apple iPhone 12 emulators are designed so that applications, and games that are designed for iPhones are made available for other cross-platforms as well. People use Apple iPhone 12 emulators to test websites and also for checking various Apple iPhone 12 applications as well.

Here are some online Apple iPhone 12 emulators which can test how the website will look like if it is made to run on an iPhone. It is great to test and redesign even if you do not have an Apple iPhone 12 at your disposal.
