The steps to mirror share Lava Blaze Pro 5G  phone on PC with Wondershare Dr.Fone are mentioned below:

**Step 1: Connect the Lava Blaze Pro 5G  Phone to PC**

Use a USB cable to connect the Lava Blaze Pro 5G  Android phone with the PC. The app will automatically detect the Lava Blaze Pro 5G device.
