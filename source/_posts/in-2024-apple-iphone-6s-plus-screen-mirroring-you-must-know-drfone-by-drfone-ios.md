For this, you can utilize the screen mirroring feature present on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to professionally manage the situation and have your message circulated across all members of the meeting without any hiatus in the decorum of the meeting. This analogy can be implied across a school, where you need to keep a progressive environment without any disruption.
