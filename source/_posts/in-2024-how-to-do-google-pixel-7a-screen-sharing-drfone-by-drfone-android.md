## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Google Pixel 7a  Phone to  Google TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Google Pixel 7a  devices that allows you to **screen share on Google Pixel 7a ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Google Pixel 7a  device to your  Google TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Google Pixel 7a  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Google Pixel 7a  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Google Pixel 7a  users to share their device's screen with  Google TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Google TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature
