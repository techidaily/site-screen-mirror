### Screen Casting vs. Screen Mirroring: What's the Difference?

You might have heard of screencasting and screen mirroring together many times. It may come as a surprise to you that these two terminologies hold considerable differences from each other. To simplify the difference, screencasting is performed with the motive of displaying the content of the screen on another output display in the same room.

For screen mirroring, you display the content of the screen on another display while showing all the movements of the screen. Screen mirroring gives you the leverage to use the smartphone without any interruption.
