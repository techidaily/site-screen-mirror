Lowering it would defeat my purpose."

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Realme 12 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Realme 12 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!
