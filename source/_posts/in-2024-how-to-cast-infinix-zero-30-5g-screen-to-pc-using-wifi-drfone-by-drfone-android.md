## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Infinix Zero 30 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Infinix Zero 30 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Infinix Zero 30 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Infinix Zero 30 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Infinix Zero 30 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!

## Part 1: Cast Contents of iPhone and Android to Computer with MirrorGo

Sometimes the smaller Android or iPhone screen isn’t enough to accurately manage the app or files available on the Infinix Zero 30 5G device. Under such circumstances, the best solution is to cast Infinix Zero 30 5G to PC using a mirroring application.

[Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/) is the safest option to perform such an activity, no matter the phone’s platform is Android or iOS. The app offers you to display your phone’s games, videos, and similar files to the much larger computer screen, where it is easy to complete the task at hand.

**Step 1: Download MirrorGo and Connect the Phone with PC**

MirrorGo is available for Windows PC. Download the application and launch it on the Infinix Zero 30 5G device. You will need to connect the Android phone with a USB cable. On the other hand, the iOS device needs to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the PC.

**Step 2: Log in with Same credentials**

To enable casting with an Android device, you need to tap on the Developer Option 7 times under the About Phone button. After that, navigate to Additional Settings, where you need to toggle-on USB Debugging.
