## How to Cast Tecno Pop 8 Screen to PC Using WiFi

Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let's discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.


## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Tecno Pop 8 deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Tecno Pop 8 deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Tecno Pop 8 deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Tecno Pop 8 devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Tecno Pop 8 device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!

### Method 2: Use Screen Mirroring App to Mirror Tecno Pop 8 to Roku

Screen Mirroring App for Roku is an easy to use application that allows sharing pictures, videos, and documents from your Android device to Roku TV. You are not required to amend any phone or wifi setting on your device. All you need to make sure is that both the Roku and your Android device is connected to the same wifi network. The data is solely captured by the application for mirroring purposes only; no information is stored.

The only drawback of this app is that it still does not support sound; hence to share sound, you need to use Bluetooth speakers.

**Step 1: Download the Screen Mirroring Application:**

- Unlock your Android device and enter the Google Play Store.
- Download the "Screen Mirroring Application" using this link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku)

![screen mirroring for roku app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/12/mirror-android-to-roku-3.jpg)

**Step 2: Mirror Tecno Pop 8 Device to Roku:**

- Launch the application. The app will start to show all the Tecno Pop 8 devices nearby to which you can share your screen.
- Select your Roku device.

**Step 3: Add Channel to your Roku:**

- On your Roku, tap on "Add Channel" to add a screen mirroring channel.
- The device will take time to process.
- Confirm your action by tapping on "OK" on the app or the Roku remote.

- From the application launched on your Android device, tap on the option of "Start Mirroring"
- After that, tap on "Start Now" from the pop-up screen to permit the app to start capturing your Android device screen.
- And you are done!

### Method 3: Use Google Home to mirror Tecno Pop 8 to Roku TV

Google Home is an excellent alternative to cast your Android to Roku; however, it only supports a handful of apps.

**Step 1: Download Google Home:**

- First, you need to download the Google Home application on your Android device.

**Step 2: Connect Android Device to Roku**

- Launch the application and tap on the "+" icon from the top left corner to reveal a menu.
