## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

- **Streamlined productivity**\- TeamViewer users can easily share their data, like documents and presentations, with different users in real-time for discussion. This is instead of the conventional method of individually emailing them for review.
- **Better onboarding and tutoring-** Professionals using TeamViewer can do onboarding and training processes. For example, by sharing the screen with participants, they can visually show how processes or software types work.
- **More robust Security-** TeamViewer runs with AES (265-bit) encryption for sessions with RSA public/private key exchange support. This assures a safe and more controlled screen-sharing experience compared to other alternatives.

To correctly share the screen to PC, TeamViewer users can access it via Android smartphones or tablets. Here are the steps to share the screen with this platform.

**Step 1:** On the Android device, visit Google Play Store > install [TeamViewer Host](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamviewer.host.market&hl=en).

**Step 2:** If you do not have an account here, create a new one or log in.
