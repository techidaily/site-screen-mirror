![samsung devices featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Motorola Edge 40 Pro  Phone to  Motorola TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Motorola Edge 40 Pro  devices that allows you to **screen share on Motorola Edge 40 Pro ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Motorola Edge 40 Pro  device to your  Motorola TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Motorola Edge 40 Pro  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Motorola TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.
