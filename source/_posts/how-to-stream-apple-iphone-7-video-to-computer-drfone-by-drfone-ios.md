## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 7 video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 7 across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 7 onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 7 has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 7 to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.
