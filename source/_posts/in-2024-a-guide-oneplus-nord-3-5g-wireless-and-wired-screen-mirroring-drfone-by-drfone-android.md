## Top 10 AirPlay Apps in OnePlus Nord 3 5G for Streaming

AirPlay has changed the way people stream their music and other media content over several devices over a common wireless network. With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.

Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.

### 1) Double Twist

We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.
