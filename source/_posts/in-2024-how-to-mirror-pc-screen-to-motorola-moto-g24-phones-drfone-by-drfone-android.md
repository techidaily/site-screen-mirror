Yes, you can mirror your computer’s screen to your Android phone. It means that you will be able to remotely access and manage the PC screen with an Android Screen. Such convenience is handy for developers, teachers, and pretty much every professional who has to deal with both PC and phone daily.

Screencasting or mirroring is also possible on a phone that isn’t rooted. However, there are a few things that you have to do from the phone’s settings menu to enable PC mirroring. It is called USB debugging. The method to debug the Android phone is as follows:

1\. You would need to connect the Android phone to the computer via USB cable to initiate the procedure;

2\. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;

3\. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;

4\. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;

5\. You will see the Build Number of the Motorola Moto G24 device. Tap on the option 7 times. It will bring the Motorola Moto G24 device into developer mode;

6\. Repeat Step 2!

## How to Cast Motorola Moto G24 Screen to PC Using WiFi

Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring.
