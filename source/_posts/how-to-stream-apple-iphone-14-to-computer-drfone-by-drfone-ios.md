Once you locate the app, you will opt for the Mirroring to the Mac option. Download the app and install it. Afterward, go to your PC to download the Chrome browser if you don’t have one yet.

**Step 2:** Now, return to your smartphone and go to Mirror Mac PC. The moment you open it, a code will pop up. Ensure that your laptop has the same network provider as Your Apple iPhone 14. Well, the reason is to get a seamless connection.

**Step 3:** Return to your Chrome browser and type: Start.airbeam.tv. The moment you do that, the code on your mobile device appears on the browser. Then click on Connect. Once you look at your smartphone, you will see a notification telling you that you are connected to the Mac operating system.

**Step 4:** Click on Start Mirroring and then Start Broadcast. At this point, your handheld device automatically connects to your browser. Everything that happens on your phone screen is shown in the Chrome browser. You can then share it with any video-conferencing tool of your choice.
