**Step 2:** In this step, you need to download ApowerMirror on your PC and install its setup. Now open the app from the Desktop.

**Step 3:** Now, use a USB cable to connect your Android device with your PC. After that, check the notification that appears on your Android device. Begin the mirroring process by clicking on the "Start Now" option in that notification.
