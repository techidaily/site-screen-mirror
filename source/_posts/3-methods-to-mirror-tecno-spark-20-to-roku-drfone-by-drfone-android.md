Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

Before explaining the steps, it is important to state that available screens and settings may change depending on your device, Smart TV, or service provider. The Smart View feature is also unavailable on all Samsung devices, and you might need to use the Smart View or Smart Things app.

**Step 1:** After connecting your device and Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network, open the "Quick Panel" on your Samsung device. Here, press and enable "Smart View."

**Step 2:** Select your  Tecno TV among the available devices when Smart View is enabled. Once connected, choose the content you want to share on the TV screen.
