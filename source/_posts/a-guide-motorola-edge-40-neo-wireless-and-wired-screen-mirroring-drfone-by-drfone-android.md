Also termed as a 'triple threat', this free media manager serves multiple functions. Starting with acting as a unified music player, it also comes useful as podcast manager. The real surprise comes in its ability to sync one's iTunes media collection. This includes playlists, music, video, and other image files, and this can be done synced within the desktop computer (both MAC and Windows) and the Android Device you have been working on. Apart from this, users would have to shell out $5 if they are looking to unlock the AirSync and AirPlay functions. That's not all, as the purchase also unlocks the DLNA support. This one is an equalizer, album art search function, and allows the users to remove podcast ads.

![stream from any Android to Apple TV-Allcast](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542162011206.jpg)

3) **Allstream:** For the ones who are only interested in music and are too lazy to switch to a new music player, this application has all the answers.

This allows the user to choose their music player which may include services like Spotify, Google Play Music, or any other while giving the streaming ability to existing AirPort express, Apple TV, Samsung Smart TV, and PS3. However, there is another catch users must be aware about. The application requires the Android device to be rooted. Also, a payment of 5 Euro is necessary if one wishes for the application to continue working after a specific amount of time. And if you like the music in Spotify, you can also [download music from Spotify](https://pro.keepvid.com/spotify/download-music-from-spotify.html) and enjoy it everywhere as you want.

## Part 5: Mirroring Android Screen to PC with Online Screen Mirroring Tool - Dr.Fone Air

With all the casting solutions provided above, it might make your experience better if you'd consider using a screen mirroring solution. [Wondershare Dr.Fone Air](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/ios-screen-mirror/) is an online screen mirroring solution that offers a quick and effective functionality to mirror the screen of your Android to a PC.

As it is a wireless solution, you have to cover the complete process with the help of a Wi-Fi connection. Rather than **casting the Android screen to a PC,** you can realize this solution as a perfect option for covering lectures, meetings, and other uses.

### Key Features Provided by the Online Screen Mirroring Solution

There are some prominent features of this online mirroring solution that makes it a special choice in the market. Let's find out more about these features below:

- You are not required to use a Bluetooth or NFC connection for mirroring the Motorola Edge 40 Neo device.
- The tool is completely free and does not have any ads associated with it.
- You can adjust the mirrored screen by zooming, rotating, or taking screenshots.

### What is the Disadvantage of Screen Casting?

Screen casting, as a process, is not better than screen mirroring. Essentially, this process does not allow you to use the mobile when it is connected to the computer. If you have connected your Android to the PC through screencasting, you will have to disconnect it to use the mobile phone.
