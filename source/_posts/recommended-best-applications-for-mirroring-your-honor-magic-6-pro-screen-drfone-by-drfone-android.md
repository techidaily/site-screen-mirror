![samsung devices featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Honor Magic 6 Pro  Phone to  Honor TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Honor Magic 6 Pro  devices that allows you to **screen share on Honor Magic 6 Pro ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Honor Magic 6 Pro  device to your  Honor TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Honor Magic 6 Pro  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.
