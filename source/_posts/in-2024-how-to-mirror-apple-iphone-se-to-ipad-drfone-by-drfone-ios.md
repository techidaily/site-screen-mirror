If we take the environment of an office into consideration, we can clearly demonstrate the use of screen mirroring during a meeting.

This demonstrates the decorum of the meeting, leaving the people present in the room in a very awkward and inconvenient situation. For this, you can utilize the screen mirroring feature present on your Apple iPhone SE to professionally manage the situation and have your message circulated across all members of the meeting without any hiatus in the decorum of the meeting.
