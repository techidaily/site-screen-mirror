## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 6 Plus video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 6 Plus across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 6 Plus onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 6 Plus has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC.

Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device.
