### Method 2: Use Screen Mirroring App to Mirror Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 to Roku

Screen Mirroring App for Roku is an easy to use application that allows sharing pictures, videos, and documents from your Android device to Roku TV. You are not required to amend any phone or wifi setting on your device. All you need to make sure is that both the Roku and your Android device is connected to the same wifi network. The data is solely captured by the application for mirroring purposes only; no information is stored.

The only drawback of this app is that it still does not support sound; hence to share sound, you need to use Bluetooth speakers.

**Step 1: Download the Screen Mirroring Application:**

- Unlock your Android device and enter the Google Play Store.
- Download the "Screen Mirroring Application" using this link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku)
