## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone 15 to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone 15 device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone 15 or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!

## How to Stream Apple iPhone 15 Video to Computer?

The world has progressed with the introduction to smartphones, where major features are being infused on a daily basis that are making the technology decrease in size and increase in the application. Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone 15 video to a computer.


## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 15 video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 15 across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 15 onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 15 has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 15 to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.

## Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone 15 video to PC with VLC Streamer

There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone 15 videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around. VLC Streamer is a perfect platform that offers you to stream videos over an Apple iPhone 15 through a PC. The process for executing this feature is quite simple and straightforward. To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.

**Step 1:** You need to download the VLC streamer across your Apple iPhone 15 and PC simultaneously. Search through the App Store and download its free version across your Apple iPhone 15. Similarly, browse the platform on your PC and download the appropriate version that suits your PC. After downloading, you need to follow the on-screen guidelines to install it across your computer efficiently.

**Step 2:** File up the movies present in your devices, mobiles, or computer on the platform. This can be executed by double-clicking on the icon present on the desktop and launching the platform on your PC.

**Step 3:** Click “Add Movies” to open up the dialog box that would help you browse the movies present on your computer. Select and add the movies onto the VLC Streamer. The movies take a while to process into the platform and would show with a prompt message of “Complete” once they are successfully added.

![add movies](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/add-movies.jpg)

**Step 4:** Open the VLC Streamer application on the Apple iPhone 15 and discover the visible computers present near it. Locate your PC and tap on it to establish a connection. The established connection would then lead you to watch all the data that has been added on the desktop application of the VLC streamer. This would help you in streaming all the movies from your PC onto the iPhone.
