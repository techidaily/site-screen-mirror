**Step 3:** Return to your Chrome browser and type: Start.airbeam.tv. The moment you do that, the code on your mobile device appears on the browser. Then click on Connect. Once you look at your smartphone, you will see a notification telling you that you are connected to the Mac operating system.

**Step 4:** Click on Start Mirroring and then Start Broadcast. At this point, your handheld device automatically connects to your browser. Everything that happens on your phone screen is shown in the Chrome browser. You can then share it with any video-conferencing tool of your choice. Similarly, you can display files, videos, and photos from your smartphone to your laptop.

## AirServer

You can also connect your iOS devices to your laptop using AirServer.

As always, ensure that laptops and iDevice use the same WiFi network. If you have iOS 11 or the newer version, you should follow these steps.

**Step 2:** Connect your Phone: Now, tap the Screen Mirroring icon on your handheld device. Once you do that, your network will begin to display the list of AirPlay-enabled receivers. That will become the name of the system that runs the Airserver. However, your smartphone should be able to support the service. That explains why you should opt for the iOS mentioned earlier. If you do not see the AirPlay icon, you have to troubleshoot your PC. At this juncture, you will see your phone screen displayed on your laptop.

Note that this works for iOS 8 and newer versions. Interestingly, you just need to follow the same steps to do it. Regardless of the iOS version, it is fast and easy.

## 5kPlayer
