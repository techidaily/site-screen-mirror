## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From ZTE Axon 40 Lite  Phone to  ZTE TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in ZTE Axon 40 Lite  devices that allows you to **screen share on ZTE Axon 40 Lite ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your ZTE Axon 40 Lite  device to your  ZTE TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your ZTE Axon 40 Lite  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The ZTE Axon 40 Lite  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow ZTE Axon 40 Lite  users to share their device's screen with  ZTE TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature
