### 4) AllShare

For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn't come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Poco X6 device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.

Got an AirPlay-enabled receiver and an Android device? Well, this app is all that you need. With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices. However, before you go on to install this app; we must notice that it is necessary for you to root your device. Alongside this, there is a short payment that must be made to enjoy all its features. Otherwise, it is a great app to have.
