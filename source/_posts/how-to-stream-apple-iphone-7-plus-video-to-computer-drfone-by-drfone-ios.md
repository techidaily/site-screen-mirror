With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.
