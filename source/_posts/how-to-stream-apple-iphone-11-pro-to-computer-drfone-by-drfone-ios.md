## Part 2: Screen Mirroring Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung TV

This part focuses on developing an understanding of iPhone users for connecting their phones onto Samsung TV through two different approaches. While believing that there are multiple approaches that can be adapted for screen mirroring Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung TV, it is significant to navigate to the most appropriate version of the screen mirroring your Apple iPhone 11 Pro X. The following methods describe the most effective and efficient approaches that can easily mirror Apple iPhone 11 Pro onto Samsung TV.

### Through AirPlay 2

AirPlay 2 has been Apple's highlight in enabling screen mirroring and helping people discover pertinent ways to share their iPhone's or iPad's screen onto larger screens. AirPlay 2 provides exemplary features in the shape of the convenient streaming of content from the phone onto the Apple TV. The compatibility is not confined to Apple TV but is supported for compatible Samsung TVs. This has enabled you for streaming movies, music, and other media from your Apple iPhone 11 Pro onto the television. For understanding the procedure of connecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung TV with the help of AirPlay 2, you need to follow the steps provided below.

**Step 1: Ensuring Internet Connection**

You need to ensure that the network connection connecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung TV is similar. It is considered as an important factor in screen mirroring iPhone X.

**Step 2: Access the Media File**

Following this, you need to open the media file that you seek to mirror onto the Samsung TV. You need to open the Photos application on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro to access the image or video that you seek to share.

**Step 3: Share the Media File**

After locating the file, you need to choose the file and tap on the 'Share' icon present on the bottom left of the screen. Select the "Airplay" icon from the link to open up a new window on the front.

**Step 4: Attach your phone with Samsung TV**

You can find the option of Samsung TV on the list that presents the available compatible devices on AirPlay. Select the appropriate option and stream the media file on the TV.

### Through Adapter

This procedure is useful for TVs that are not compatible with AirPlay and cannot be connected with the iPhone wirelessly. In this case, you need to connect your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to the Smart TV through a digital AV Adapter. For understanding the procedure of connecting your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung TV using a digital AV adapter, you need to look over the step-by-step guide provided below.

**Step 1: Connect HDMI cable to the TV**

You need to attach an HDMI cable from the back of the TV after turning it on. Have the HDMI cable connected to the Lightning Digital AV Adapter.

**Step 2: Connect your Phone**

After connecting your AV adapter, connect its end to the iPhone and access the HDMI option from the ‘Input’ section of your Samsung TV. This would simply mirror your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Samsung TV.
