## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Motorola G24 Power  Phone to  Motorola TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Motorola G24 Power  devices that allows you to **screen share on Motorola G24 Power ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Motorola G24 Power  device to your  Motorola TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Motorola G24 Power  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Motorola G24 Power  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Motorola G24 Power  users to share their device's screen with  Motorola TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Motorola TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2011 LED D7000 and above, PDP D8000 and above.
- 2012 LED ES7500 and above, PDP E8000 and above.
- 2013 LED F4500 and above (except F9000 and above), PDP F5500 and above.

- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature
