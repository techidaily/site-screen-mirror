I don't have interference between my mobile & Wi-Fi adapter. If it wasn't for the lag, I'd give this 5 stars. The only fix I see is lowering the res, but I actually need HD.

It works well, has a very low lag, good screen reproduction, and best of all, it doesn't use a 3rd party system to send or receive messages. I've looked for an app like this, but others require rooting your phone or using a web-based system to control your phone through their servers. This app is the best I've found, with more than adequate performance."
