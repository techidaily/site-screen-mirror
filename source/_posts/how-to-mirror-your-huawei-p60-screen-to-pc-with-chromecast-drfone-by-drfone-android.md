## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing.

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Huawei P60  devices that allows you to **screen share on Huawei P60 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
