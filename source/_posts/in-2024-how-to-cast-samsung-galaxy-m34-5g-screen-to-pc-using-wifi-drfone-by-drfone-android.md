## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Samsung Galaxy M34 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

It also converts your Android Device into all-in-one remote control.

However, a version later or equal to Android 4.0 or iOS 6.0 is necessary if one is looking to use this free application.
