## Part 1. Why go for Screen Mirroring at All?

The reason why screen mirroring on Itel P40 is in vogue is that you wish for the display on your phone in larger displays like TV and computer monitors. To enable Screen Mirroring, try and connect an All-Share Cast dongle, Miracast device, HDMI cable, or HomeSync to the display. When the screen's mirroring is over, enjoy games, multimedia files, and a plethora of other content on the phone with a nice and bigger display.
