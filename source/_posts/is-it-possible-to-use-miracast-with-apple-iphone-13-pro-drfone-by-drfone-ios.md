## Method 3: Share Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Screen Over FaceTime (SharePlay)

FaceTime can be another great technique to consider screen sharing Apple iPhone with other people. If you wish to show something important to some people, you can dial them through FaceTime and share the important thing in no time. FaceTime has recently adopted the SharePlay technology to give a wholesome experience in screen sharing.

Users with iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, or later can initiate a FaceTime call with the Music or Apple TV app for sharing music or video content, respectively. Where the applications can change, the process remains the same. FaceTime is quite diverse in functionality, which involves sharing the iPhone's screen.

### What Are the Requirements?

- iPhones and iPads running on iOS/iPadOS 15.4 and above allows users to start the FaceTime call through the Apple TV app (+ other supported streaming apps) and Music app (+ other music app alternatives). Then, they can use SharePlay for video/music sharing via the call with other participants.
- To screen share Apple iPhone 13 Pro to iPhone via FaceTime, the person sharing the content and the recipient should both have iOS 15.1+ (iPhones), macOS 12.1+ (Mac), or iPadOS 15.1+ (iPads).
- Users need Apple ID to access FaceTime.

With all these provisions in mind, you must follow the steps explained below to share your Apple iPhone 13 Pro screen over FaceTime with ease:

**Step 1:** You must start a FaceTime call and connect with your respective personnel. As you connect successfully, select the "Share Content" button on the top of the screen to start screen sharing.

![tap on the share content button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-iphone-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** To establish a connection, select the "Share My Screen" button, which will initiate a countdown for sharing the screen.

![select the share my screen option](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-iphone-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** To end the screen sharing, you will have to tap on the "Share Content" button again to disconnect screen sharing.

## Method 4: Share Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Screen to a Mac or Windows PC Using a Third-Party App

If you are not satisfied with the provided methods above and intend to extend your screen sharing to Windows PC along with the Mac, you will need a third-party application to execute the process. There are multiple third-party applications existing for this purpose; however, we will help you select the best one in the options.
