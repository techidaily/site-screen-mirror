### Method 2: Use Screen Mirroring App to Mirror Samsung Galaxy S24+ to Roku

Screen Mirroring App for Roku is an easy to use application that allows sharing pictures, videos, and documents from your Android device to Roku TV. You are not required to amend any phone or wifi setting on your device. All you need to make sure is that both the Roku and your Android device is connected to the same wifi network. The data is solely captured by the application for mirroring purposes only; no information is stored.

The only drawback of this app is that it still does not support sound; hence to share sound, you need to use Bluetooth speakers.

**Step 1: Download the Screen Mirroring Application:**

- Unlock your Android device and enter the Google Play Store.
- Download the "Screen Mirroring Application" using this link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku)

- Select your Roku device.

**Step 3: Add Channel to your Roku:**

- On your Roku, tap on "Add Channel" to add a screen mirroring channel.
- The device will take time to process.
- Confirm your action by tapping on "OK" on the app or the Roku remote.

**Step 4: Share your Android screen to Roku:**

- From the application launched on your Android device, tap on the option of "Start Mirroring"
- After that, tap on "Start Now" from the pop-up screen to permit the app to start capturing your Android device screen.
- And you are done!

### Method 3: Use Google Home to mirror Samsung Galaxy S24+ to Roku TV

Google Home is an excellent alternative to cast your Android to Roku; however, it only supports a handful of apps.

**Step 1: Download Google Home:**

- First, you need to download the Google Home application on your Android device.

**Step 2: Connect Android Device to Roku**

- Launch the application and tap on the "+" icon from the top left corner to reveal a menu.
