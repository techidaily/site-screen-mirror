## Part 1: Cast Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Mac via AirPlay \[Best Choice\]

AirPlay is the dedicated technique available to cast the iPhone onto a Mac. While this is the direct option Apple provides for its devices, it is pretty simple to cover. You need to process a few basic steps to **cast to MacBook** with the help of this functionality. However, there are multiple drawbacks to using AirPlay in casting devices, which shall be discussed later.

Before that, let's look into how you can cast your Apple iPhone 11 Pro to Mac using AirPlay:

**Step 1:** To start with the process, you will have to connect the iPhone and the Mac to the same Wi-Fi network. Afterward, access the "Control Center" of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

To know more about these problems, let's look ahead to figure out which one of the issues might be causing issues for you while **casting from Apple iPhone 11 Pro to MacBook:**
