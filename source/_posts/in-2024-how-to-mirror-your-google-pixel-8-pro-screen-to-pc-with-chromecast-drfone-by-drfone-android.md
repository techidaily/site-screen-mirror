After the above steps have been done successfully, your devices will have been mirrored successfully, and you can now start to enjoy the experience that comes with it. For connection through Wi-Fi for the two android devices. Take note of the above steps;

•Connect the two devices that you want to mirror to the same Wi-Fi network

•You can also connect your tablet to your phone's mobile hotspot if you are traveling, on Screen service for both the Google Pixel 8 Pro devices you want to mirror, set wireless network like Wi-Fi, on the tablet service screen, select your phone name to start the connection, then complete the process by confirming on your phone.

While ScreenShare has been used as an example here, there are many other tools you can use to get the same experience. Most of the tools can be downloaded online for free, while others are for a fee. Some of the most popular tools include; Air Playit, Optia, MirrorOp, PeerDeviceNet. Sampling the tools and getting the best that suits the experience you desire is also a good idea, or you can look up the reviews that have been written by other users, and you can pick one or two issues you like or dislike. Most, if not all the tools, have manuals that can even help you get started as they might defer a bit from the ScreenShare example given in this article.
