As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone XS across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone XS onto a computer.

With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone XS to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.
