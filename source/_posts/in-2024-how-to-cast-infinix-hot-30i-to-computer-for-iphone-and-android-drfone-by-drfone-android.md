## Part 2. Key Benefits of the TeamViewer Screenshare Tool

When users operate with TeamViewer to **screen-share to PC**, there are many advantages they can enjoy. Here are some of them, explained in points for your reference.

- **Improved collaboration**\- Professionals in different sectors and sizes can collaborate better using the TeamViewer screen-sharing feature. Organizers can share their Android screens with different meeting participants. And then the latter can work on the documents from any location or device.
- **Streamlined productivity**\- TeamViewer users can easily share their data, like documents and presentations, with different users in real-time for discussion. This is instead of the conventional method of individually emailing them for review.
- **Better onboarding and tutoring-** Professionals using TeamViewer can do onboarding and training processes. For example, by sharing the screen with participants, they can visually show how processes or software types work.
- **More robust Security-** TeamViewer runs with AES (265-bit) encryption for sessions with RSA public/private key exchange support. This assures a safe and more controlled screen-sharing experience compared to other alternatives.

To correctly share the screen to PC, TeamViewer users can access it via Android smartphones or tablets. Here are the steps to share the screen with this platform.

**Step 1:** On the Android device, visit Google Play Store > install [TeamViewer Host](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamviewer.host.market&hl=en).

**Step 2:** If you do not have an account here, create a new one or log in.
