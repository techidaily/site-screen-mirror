Another screen mirroring platform that we can take into notice is the free Mirror Nokia C12 Chrome application. AllCast provides you with an explicit solution for mirroring the contents from your Android Phone onto a screen that can either be your PC, another phone, or a videogame console. The diversity offered at AllCast Receiver is quite a treat for many users, with no costs. However, while using it, you need to understand the difference between AllCast and AllCast Receiver. These two applications are not the same by any means and have different dominions of installation. AllCast should be installed on the PC where you wish to mirror your screen, and AllCast Receiver should be installed on your Android phone, from where you have to share the screen onto another device. The application provides a vibrant feature set with the option of audio and video support during live streaming, along with the characteristics of photo sharing and screen sharing. This screen mirroring platform is available across all kinds of Operating Systems.
