## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## A Guide Vivo Y78 5G Wireless and Wired Screen Mirroring

In simple words, screen mirroring is an approach to mirror the screens of two devices with one another. For instance, you can mirror your Android phone screen on the computer and the other way round. In this article, viewers will get to know how to mirror an Android screen on PC wirelessly or through a USB cable.

Screen Mirroring is quite useful in many ways. It allows you to display the screen of your Android phone, tablet, or PC on another device through a wired or wireless connection between both devices. In today’s life, not everyone is familiar with screen mirroring technology.

## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring?

Screen Mirroring is such technology that permits you to display your content from your device to another device. In the case of screen mirroring Vivo Y78 5G PC, this could be done through both wireless and wired connections. At the same time, screen mirroring can be done when one device continuously sends the copy of its screen to another targeted device simultaneously.

In a meeting or presentation, screen mirroring plays an important role by facilitating team members to avoid complex setups and share their screens immediately. Moreover, screen mirroring supports the BYOD model, that is, "Bring Your Own Device." The reason for supporting this model is to lower the cost and increase efficiency.
