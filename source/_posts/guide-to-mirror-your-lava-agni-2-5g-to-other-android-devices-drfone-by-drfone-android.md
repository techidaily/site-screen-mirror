**Price:** Premium - $52.90/month; Corporate - $102.90/month

**Rating**: 2.3/5

**Review**: "Works great until one day, TeamViewer thinks your use is commercial, and then they only let you use it for 30 seconds at a time before disconnecting you for 10 minutes. I filled out the form declaring that my use was non-commercial, scanned it, and sent it to TeamViewer, but it made no difference. I'd be willing to pay for the personal use of the product, but it's not even an option."
