### 2\. Reflector (iOS 11.0 or Earlier)

If you have an iOS device with iOS 11.0 or earlier, you might have to look for other options. Reflector can be a good third-party application for sharing the screen on Mac and Windows. Since it utilizes AirPlay technology to connect devices for sharing screens, it creates an AirPlay receiver on the Windows PC.

The Reflector serves as a great tool to mirror the Apple iPhone 6 Plus to other screens. If you wish to know how to execute the process using Reflector, look through the steps below:

**Step 1:** You have to connect the iPhone and the computer to the same Wi-Fi connection and launch Reflector on your computer.

**Step 2:** Continue to open the Control Center by swiping from the top and selecting the option of "Screen Mirroring." You will have to hold the button to access the next screen. Select the computer from the list and establish a connection between the Apple iPhone 6 Plus devices.

### Conclusion

Multiple high-quality tools and programs are available for iPhone users to share their phone screen on Mac devices or vice versa. You can use these preset options or try out a more feature-rich, cross-platform screen mirroring software like [Dr.Fone Air](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/ios-screen-mirror/).

Consider the uses and benefits of all options and then decide on your preferred approach for sharing on-screen content via iPhones.
