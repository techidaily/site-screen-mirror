The wireless mirroring solutions that we have encountered through lack of the quality that iTools possesses with its wired explication. With the requirement of iTools to be tethered with the computer, it cast outs all the discrepancies leading due to incompatibility through Wi-Fi. Along with providing impressive Apple iPhone 12 Pro mirroring to PC features, iTools comes up with its screenshot and recording capabilities. The screen that is being shared on the PC can be recorded or captured in the way it is being displayed for keeping a record of the mirroring. Along with that, iTools allows us to connect with the microphone, leading to a voiceover feature that is covered primarily with the external microphones instead of the built-in audio systems.

Conclusively, there is no obligation for you to have the software installed on your device. Instead, iTools deals with all the mirroring opportunities by being installed on your Windows or Mac. This freeware provides compatibility to many older versions of the iPad, making it quite a platform to have your screen mirrored on.
