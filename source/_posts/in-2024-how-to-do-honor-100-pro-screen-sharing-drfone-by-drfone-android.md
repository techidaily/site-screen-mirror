## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Honor 100 Pro  Phone to  Honor TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Honor 100 Pro  devices that allows you to **screen share on Honor 100 Pro ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Honor 100 Pro  device to your  Honor TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Honor 100 Pro  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Honor 100 Pro  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Honor 100 Pro  users to share their device's screen with  Honor TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Honor TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2011 LED D7000 and above, PDP D8000 and above.
- 2012 LED ES7500 and above, PDP E8000 and above.
- 2013 LED F4500 and above (except F9000 and above), PDP F5500 and above.
- 2014 H4500, H5500 and above (except H6003/H6103/H6153/H6201/H6203).
- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).

**Review**: "Galaxy Note 9 - This app does exactly what I need it to. It works well, has a very low lag, good screen reproduction, and best of all, it doesn't use a 3rd party system to send or receive messages. I've looked for an app like this, but others require rooting your phone or using a web-based system to control your phone through their servers. This app is the best I've found, with more than adequate performance."

## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror Honor 100 Pro to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror Honor 100 Pro to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| **Cons of Using USB Connection** | **Pros of Using Wireless Connection** |
| --- | --- |
| The wire that you might be used to establish the USB connection would be damaged, which is causing issues in attaching the Honor 100 Pro devices. | There are no threats of damaging any wire, which will disrupt the connection. |
| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Honor 100 Pro device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Honor 100 Pro device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Honor 100 Pro devices, saving you extra costs. |

### Conclusion

This article has provided an overview of the best methods available to **mirror Honor 100 Pro to Mac** properly. As you have had the option of mirroring the Honor 100 Pro devices through USB and wireless connections, it gives you clarity in selecting the best one.
