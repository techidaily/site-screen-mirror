### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg)

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/airplay-and-dlna-player.jpg)

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

## 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Samsung Galaxy A14 5G PC

Screen Mirroring has introduced itself as a vibrant feature that allows people to share their screen onto more significant dimensions for people to watch the content thoroughly. You might encounter a situation where you cannot read a document easily on your phone's screen and zoom in to apprehend the content. Thus, it leads you to a situation where you can observe the screen in a better way by sharing it onto a larger screen. For that, Android phones can be mirrored onto PC screens with the help of different third-party applications. Android potentially does not provide a direct screen mirroring feature on their phones, which leads to the need for third-party screen mirroring applications.
