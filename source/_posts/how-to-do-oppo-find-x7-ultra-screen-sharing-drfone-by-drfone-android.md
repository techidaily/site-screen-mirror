## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

2\. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;

3\. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;

4\. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;
