## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone 7 to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone 7 device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone 7 or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!

FaceTime has recently adopted the SharePlay technology to give a wholesome experience in screen sharing.

Users with iOS 15.4, iPadOS 15.4, or later can initiate a FaceTime call with the Music or Apple TV app for sharing music or video content, respectively. Where the applications can change, the process remains the same. FaceTime is quite diverse in functionality, which involves sharing the iPhone's screen.

### What Are the Requirements?

- iPhones and iPads running on iOS/iPadOS 15.4 and above allows users to start the FaceTime call through the Apple TV app (+ other supported streaming apps) and Music app (+ other music app alternatives). Then, they can use SharePlay for video/music sharing via the call with other participants.
- To screen share Apple iPhone 7 to iPhone via FaceTime, the person sharing the content and the recipient should both have iOS 15.1+ (iPhones), macOS 12.1+ (Mac), or iPadOS 15.1+ (iPads).
- Users need Apple ID to access FaceTime.

With all these provisions in mind, you must follow the steps explained below to share your Apple iPhone 7 screen over FaceTime with ease:

**Step 1:** You must start a FaceTime call and connect with your respective personnel. As you connect successfully, select the "Share Content" button on the top of the screen to start screen sharing.
