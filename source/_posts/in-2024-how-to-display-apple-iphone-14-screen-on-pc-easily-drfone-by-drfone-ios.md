You should follow the steps below to do that.

**Step 1:** You need to download and install the app on your smartphone. To do that, go to your app store and search AirbeamTV. Once you locate the app, you will opt for the Mirroring to the Mac option. Download the app and install it. Afterward, go to your PC to download the Chrome browser if you don’t have one yet.

**Step 2:** Now, return to your smartphone and go to Mirror Mac PC. The moment you open it, a code will pop up. Ensure that your laptop has the same network provider as Your Apple iPhone 14. Well, the reason is to get a seamless connection.

**Step 3:** Return to your Chrome browser and type: Start.airbeam.tv. The moment you do that, the code on your mobile device appears on the browser. Then click on Connect. Once you look at your smartphone, you will see a notification telling you that you are connected to the Mac operating system.

**Step 4:** Click on Start Mirroring and then Start Broadcast. At this point, your handheld device automatically connects to your browser. Everything that happens on your phone screen is shown in the Chrome browser. You can then share it with any video-conferencing tool of your choice.

![stream iphone to computer 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-03.jpg)

As always, ensure that laptops and iDevice use the same WiFi network. If you have iOS 11 or the newer version, you should follow these steps.

**Step 1:** Once your iDevice is connected to your laptop, head to the bottom of the screen to access the Control Center. You can access the Control Center on any iPhone by swiping down the top right corner of the screen.

**Step 2:** Connect your Phone: Now, tap the Screen Mirroring icon on your handheld device. Once you do that, your network will begin to display the list of AirPlay-enabled receivers. That will become the name of the system that runs the Airserver. However, your smartphone should be able to support the service. That explains why you should opt for the iOS mentioned earlier. If you do not see the AirPlay icon, you have to troubleshoot your PC. At this juncture, you will see your phone screen displayed on your laptop.

Note that this works for iOS 8 and newer versions. Interestingly, you just need to follow the same steps to do it. Regardless of the iOS version, it is fast and easy.

## 5kPlayer

Having discussed other ways you can stream the iPhone screen to pc, 5kPlayer is yet another method. You see, 5KPlayer is a software system that accesses desktops to stream or cast the screen of your iDevice.

![stream iphone to computer 4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/10/stream-iphone-to-computer-04.jpg)

To get started, you will need AirPlay with 5KPlayer with an iDevice that runs on iOS 13. Once you meet these requirements, you should take these steps.

**Step 1:** Launch 5KPlayer on your computer and then click on the AirPlay icon to turn it on.

**Step 2:** Make your way to your Apple iPhone 14’s Control Center by swiping down on it.

**Step 3:** At this point, you have to tap on the Screen/AirPlay Mirroring. When the Apple iPhone 14 device list pops up, you should choose your computer. At this juncture, you have accomplished your task because your phone screen will appear on your desktop. You can stream now!

In truth, to stream Apple iPhone 14 to Windows 10 using 5KPlayer is simple and easy to follow. All you have to do is to follow the steps outlined above. Once you have completed the process, you can cast your video and image from your cellphone to your system. It is even more interesting than it works with iPads too.

![choose MirrorGo under screen mirroring choices](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone/connect-iphone-to-computer-via-airplay.jpg)

**Step 3:** At this point, you have completed the task. All you have to do is start mirroring and exploring the content of your cellphone on your desktop.

Once you have established the connection, you can also control your cellphone from the same computer. To do that, you need to get a mouse or use your trackpad. When you get to Step 3 above, activate your phone’s AssisiveTouch and pair it with your system’s Bluetooth. Now, that’s all there is to it!

## Conclusion

From the onset, we promised to simplify the steps, and we did. The thing is, you can choose any of the four options outlined above to stream your iDevices to your desktop. Note that the AirbeamTV option does not necessarily have to be a Mac OS. Given that Chrome runs on all platforms, you can use both Windows and Mac systems. All you need to do is install the Chrome browser and start streaming your cellphone to your PC. In other words, you do not need cables to stream your Apple iPhone 14 to your PC because this process is wireless.

Remember, it runs on a WiFi connection. Once you have done it, you can have a better view of your cellphone and share certain activities on Your Apple iPhone 14 with everyone in the room. It can do it during your board meeting or at home. For instance, you may further project to a screen, allowing more people in the office to watch you, as you demonstrate stuff from Your Apple iPhone 14. This, in turn, improves workflow, culminates in improved collaboration, and less time-wasting. Now, it is time to return to the steps and give it a shot.
