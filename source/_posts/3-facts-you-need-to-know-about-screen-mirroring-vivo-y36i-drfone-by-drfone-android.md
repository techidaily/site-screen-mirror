Today most people are using smartphones with an android operating system which actually has become the first choice for so many people. Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring. So, let's discuss what screen mirroring and casting is actually and how to cast android screen to PC using WiFi.

To understand the simple process of mirroring your Android screen across the PC, you need to follow the steps explained as follows:

**Step 1: Download, Install and Launch**

Users are requested to download the latest version of MirrorGo from their official website. Once installed, launch the application on the computer.

**Step 2: Same Internet Connection**

The user needs to ensure that the PC and Android device are connected across the same Wi-Fi connection. Once done, tap on the option of “Mirror Vivo Y36i PC via Wi-Fi” on the lower bottom of the application’s interface.

**Step 3: Attach through USB over Unsuccessful Connection**

If the user fails to mirror the Vivo Y36i device directly through Wi-Fi, they can connect their Android device with the PC via USB. Before that, it is important to turn on USB Debugging across the Android device for successful connection. Once the phone appears under "Select a device to connect," you can remove the Android phone from the USB connection.
