## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Vivo Y200  Phone to  Vivo TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Vivo Y200  devices that allows you to **screen share on Vivo Y200 ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Vivo Y200  device to your  Vivo TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Vivo Y200  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Vivo Y200  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Vivo Y200  users to share their device's screen with  Vivo TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Vivo TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen
