| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Poco X5 Pro device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Poco X5 Pro device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
