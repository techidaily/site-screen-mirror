At the same time, screen mirroring can be done when one device continuously sends the copy of its screen to another targeted device simultaneously.

In a meeting or presentation, screen mirroring plays an important role by facilitating team members to avoid complex setups and share their screens immediately. Moreover, screen mirroring supports the BYOD model, that is, "Bring Your Own Device." The reason for supporting this model is to lower the cost and increase efficiency.

## Part 2: Prerequisites for Android Screen Mirroring

To successfully cast Android screen to PC, the screen mirroring apps should work properly. For this purpose, it is recommended to do some settings on your Android device. The steps of settings for enabling both developer options and USB debugging are discussed below:

**Enable Developer option**

**Step 1:** Open the “Settings” app on your Android phone and choose “System” settings from the list. Now click on the “About Phone” option from the top of the screen.

**Step 2:** Now, you need to scroll down and click the “Build Number” option five times.

**Step 3:** Proceed back on the “System” settings, where you will find a "Developer" option present.

**Enable USB Debugging**

**Step 1:** First, open your Android phone “Settings” and go to “System” settings. Now click on the “Developers” option on the next screen.
