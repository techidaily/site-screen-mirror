Whether there is a need to show unique clicks or videos on a bigger screen or want to stream amazing content on big TVs or computers, we must know **how to screen share on a Vivo Y36  phone.** It becomes a lot easier to cater to a big audience with big screens.

So today, let us go through a detailed guide on **how to screen share in Vivo Y36 ** to smart TVs and computers.

![samsung devices featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.
