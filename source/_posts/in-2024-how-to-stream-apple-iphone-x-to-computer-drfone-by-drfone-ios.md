## Apple iPhone X Mirror to PC? Top Apps You Must Know

Technology has not only provided people with effective solutions but developed a ground that would enable innovators to make these solutions more robust and appropriate for global use. Screen mirroring might be considered a very simple feature that is utilized for covering the basic needs of connecting your devices onto larger screens, allowing you to enjoy the view with your family or share the presentation or graphical reports with your colleagues during an office meeting. iPads might be referred to as smarter versions of laptops, which usually leads you to such a position where you cannot [display your screens](https://drfone.wondershare.com/mirror-emulator/share-ipad-screen-with-pc.html) to a larger crowd at the same time. This leads us to the need for screen sharing iPad's screen onto a PC. This article discusses various methods that can be consumed to mirror the Apple iPhone X screen to the PC.

## Part 1: Is there any free solution to mirror the Apple iPhone X screen to PC?

We might be aware of many paid solutions that are available both on the Internet and the App Store aiding users into mirroring their Apple iPhone X screen to PC. Conversely, there is a sea of different options that are available for free when discovering the best application to serve for screen sharing Apple iPhone X to PC. If you look for the perfect solution that helps you mirror iPad's screen to the computer for free, iTools is one impressive software developed by ThinkSky that provides its consumers with a wired screen mirroring opportunity by connecting the Apple Device with the help of the simple cable.

The wireless mirroring solutions that we have encountered through lack of the quality that iTools possesses with its wired explication. With the requirement of iTools to be tethered with the computer, it cast outs all the discrepancies leading due to incompatibility through Wi-Fi. Along with providing impressive Apple iPhone X mirroring to PC features, iTools comes up with its screenshot and recording capabilities. The screen that is being shared on the PC can be recorded or captured in the way it is being displayed for keeping a record of the mirroring. Along with that, iTools allows us to connect with the microphone, leading to a voiceover feature that is covered primarily with the external microphones instead of the built-in audio systems.

Conclusively, there is no obligation for you to have the software installed on your device. Instead, iTools deals with all the mirroring opportunities by being installed on your Windows or Mac. This freeware provides compatibility to many older versions of the iPad, making it quite a platform to have your screen mirrored on.
