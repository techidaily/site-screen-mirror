## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Oppo Reno 10 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Oppo Reno 10 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Oppo Reno 10 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Oppo Reno 10 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Oppo Reno 10 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!
