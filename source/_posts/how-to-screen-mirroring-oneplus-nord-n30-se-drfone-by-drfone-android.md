## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror OnePlus Nord N30 SE to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| **Cons of Using USB Connection** | **Pros of Using Wireless Connection** |
| --- | --- |
| The wire that you might be used to establish the USB connection would be damaged, which is causing issues in attaching the OnePlus Nord N30 SE devices. | There are no threats of damaging any wire, which will disrupt the connection. |
| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the OnePlus Nord N30 SE device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the OnePlus Nord N30 SE devices, saving you extra costs. |
