## Part 1. Mirror PC Screen to Android - Can I Cast Screen from Windows to Android?

Screencasting or mirroring is also possible on a phone that isn’t rooted. However, there are a few things that you have to do from the phone’s settings menu to enable PC mirroring. It is called USB debugging. The method to debug the Android phone is as follows:

1\. You would need to connect the Android phone to the computer via USB cable to initiate the procedure;

2\. Tap on the Settings menu of your Android device;

3\. Go to Additional Settings and tap on Developer Options;

4\. If you are unable to see the option, then go back to the settings page and tap on About Phone;

5\. You will see the Build Number of the Itel A70 device. Tap on the option 7 times. It will bring the Itel A70 device into developer mode;

6\. Repeat Step 2!
