Although you can enjoy so many brilliant and advanced features on the android platform, the thing which makes people sometimes annoyed and uneasy at the same time is an inferior visual experience on a small screen. People often miss their good experiences on large screens when they watch their favorite videos and movies even while they are making video calls to their favorite persons. But now the time has changed and so has the technology which literally allows you to enjoy the benefit of a large screen with your same small android device. This is called screen mirroring.

Android to Android mirroring is amazing, and you just might want to try it out. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even mobile hotspots.

While there are many tools for android to android mirroring, this example will use ScreenShare, which uses ScreenShare Technology to allow two android to android mirror through Bluetooth, mobile hotspots, or Wi-Fi. This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets. It also uses the ScreenShare browser, ScreenShare service, and ScreenShare organizer that help manage Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection and your data exchange between your two mirrored devices.

**Requirements**

- • A tablet running Android 2.3+
- • A smartphone running Android 2.3+

4\. If one of the Honor X50 GT devices that you want to mirror is a tablet, start with it. Find your smartphone name in the Paired Devices list in ScreenShare service. Select your phone name, then tap OK, so that the connection starts. The connection should start from your tablet.

5\. The connection should be confirmed by tapping OK on your phone. This is an important step as it establishes a ScreenShare connection.

6\. As confirmation of the establishment of the ScreenShare connection, an icon will display on the status bar. Also, a "Connected" status should appear for your other device in the paired Devices list. In the circumstance that you fail to connect the first time, you will be required to wait for at least 10 to 20 seconds, after which you will have to try step 4 and 5.

After the above steps have been done successfully, your devices will have been mirrored successfully, and you can now start to enjoy the experience that comes with it. For connection through Wi-Fi for the two android devices. Take note of the above steps;

•Connect the two devices that you want to mirror to the same Wi-Fi network

•You can also connect your tablet to your phone's mobile hotspot if you are traveling, on Screen service for both the Honor X50 GT devices you want to mirror, set wireless network like Wi-Fi, on the tablet service screen, select your phone name to start the connection, then complete the process by confirming on your phone.

While ScreenShare has been used as an example here, there are many other tools you can use to get the same experience. Most of the tools can be downloaded online for free, while others are for a fee. Some of the most popular tools include; Air Playit, Optia, MirrorOp, PeerDeviceNet. Sampling the tools and getting the best that suits the experience you desire is also a good idea, or you can look up the reviews that have been written by other users, and you can pick one or two issues you like or dislike. Most, if not all the tools, have manuals that can even help you get started as they might defer a bit from the ScreenShare example given in this article.
