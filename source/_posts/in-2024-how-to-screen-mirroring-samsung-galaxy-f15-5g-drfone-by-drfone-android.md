## Part 1: What is Screen Mirroring Android and Casting

Today, most android devices are coming with a built-in screen mirroring feature which simply allows you to upgrade and enhance your viewing experience. With this, you can simply mirror the android screen on a PC via WiFi. And for this, all you just need is the right platform for both of your devices which means your PC, as well as your smartphone, must have some built-in cast screen or screen mirror feature or software as well.

So, here you can say that Screen Mirroring is basically a process where you can actually replicate the screen of your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G deviceon a larger screen like a Computer or Laptop. Not only this, but you can also present your android mobile screen on your Smart TVs or other wireless display supported devices as well.

There is basically three wireless screen mirroring technologies for android. One is Chromecast, the second is Miracast and the next is third-party Software. With Miracast, you can simply enjoy the benefit of screen mirroring of your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G deviceon your computer or Smart TV.

However Screencasting is somehow different from screen mirroring where you simply are required to click on the cast icon of related apps on your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G deviceand ultimately you will be able to view the content playing directly by the casting device like Android TV or Chromecast etc.

Thereafter, all you need to do is operate your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G devicefor changing the displaying content from the different apps stored in your Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device like Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube, etc. And then your selected content will be directly picked up by the streaming device which should be connected to the same Wi-Fi as to your android.

In this given post, here we are going to provide you with the different choices where you can easily view phone screens on PC via WiFi. So, let's try all of the options and choose one best!

## Part 2: Casting Android Screen to PC with ChromeCast

For using this method, you will be required to create a personal Wi-Fi Hotspot. Here you can follow this method in the following way:

**For Computer**:

- Go to the 'Search' Bar.
- Type 'Connect'.
- Open 'Connect App.

Here you will find suitable options for hotspot connection.

**For Android (Version 5,6, 7)**:

- Go to 'Settings'.
- Choose 'Display'.
- Select 'Cast'.
- Then click on the three dots to view 'Menu'.
- Then choose the 'Enable Wireless Display' option.

**For Android (Version 8)**:

- Go to 'Settings'.
- Choose 'Connected Devices'.
- Select 'Cast'.
- Then click on the three dots to view 'Menu'.
- Then choose the 'Enable Wireless Display' option.

Now you have to wait until and unless the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device is found. You can check the name of your system in the 'Connect' app.

- Then click on the Samsung Galaxy F15 5G device name.

With this, you will be able to cast the screen of one device to another.

## Part 3: Casting Android Screen to PC with MiraCast

The next method which you can possibly consider using is MiraCast for mirroring your screen over the internet.

Here for turning your PC into a Miracast receiver, you can simply follow the given steps:

- Turn On Your PC.
- Go to the 'Start menu.
- Now click on the 'Connect' app.

If you are not finding this app, I would like to suggest you upgrade your system to the Anniversary update.

Now when you open the 'connect' app, it will display a message regarding your system being ready to attach wirelessly on your screen. That's it.

Here you are absolutely not required to interact with any network server settings or any firewall as well. So, simply tap to open the app every time you need this.
