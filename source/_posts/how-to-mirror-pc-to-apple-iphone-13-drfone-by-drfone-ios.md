- ****Restricted resolution:****Users who desire to stream 4K content may find that AirPlay can only stream information at a maximum quality of 1080p.
- ****Restricted range:****Because AirPlay depends on a robust Wi-Fi connection, its content may be constrained.
- ****Restricted multi-room audio:**** While AirPlay does provide multi-room audio, it is only compatible with AirPlay 2 devices, which may not be present on all AirPlay-enabled devices.
