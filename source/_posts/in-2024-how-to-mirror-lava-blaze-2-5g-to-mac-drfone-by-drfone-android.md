## Part 3: Which is the Best Way to Mirror Lava Blaze 2 5G to Mac: Via USB or Wireless?

As you have reviewed how to mirror Lava Blaze 2 5G to Mac, we will now figure out which direction would serve the best purpose. Let's look into a comparative analysis of whether USB connection or wireless connections are preferred in screen mirroring:

| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Lava Blaze 2 5G device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Lava Blaze 2 5G devices, saving you extra costs. |
