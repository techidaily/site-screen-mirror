Android to Android mirroring is amazing, and you just might want to try it out. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even mobile hotspots.

While there are many tools for android to android mirroring, this example will use ScreenShare, which uses ScreenShare Technology to allow two android to android mirror through Bluetooth, mobile hotspots, or Wi-Fi. This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets. It also uses the ScreenShare browser, ScreenShare service, and ScreenShare organizer that help manage Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection and your data exchange between your two mirrored devices.

**Requirements**

- • A tablet running Android 2.3+
- • A smartphone running Android 2.3+
