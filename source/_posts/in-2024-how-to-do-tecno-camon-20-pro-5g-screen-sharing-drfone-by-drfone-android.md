## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G  Phone to  Tecno TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G  devices that allows you to **screen share on Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.
