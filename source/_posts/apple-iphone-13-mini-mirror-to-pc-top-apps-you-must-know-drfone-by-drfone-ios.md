- ****Restricted third-party support:****AirPlay may not be supported by all third-party devices, limiting its utility for users who want to stream content to non-Apple devices.
- ****Restricted compatibility:****Because AirPlay is primarily intended to operate with Apple products, it may not be compatible with other products like Android smartphones or intelligent Televisions made by other companies.
- ****Restricted resolution:****Users who desire to stream 4K content may find that AirPlay can only stream information at a maximum quality of 1080p.
- ****Restricted range:****Because AirPlay depends on a robust Wi-Fi connection, its content may be constrained.
- ****Restricted multi-room audio:**** While AirPlay does provide multi-room audio, it is only compatible with AirPlay 2 devices, which may not be present on all AirPlay-enabled devices.
