I don't have interference between my mobile & Wi-Fi adapter. If it wasn't for the lag, I'd give this 5 stars. The only fix I see is lowering the res, but I actually need HD. Lowering it would defeat my purpose."

I've looked for an app like this, but others require rooting your phone or using a web-based system to control your phone through their servers.
