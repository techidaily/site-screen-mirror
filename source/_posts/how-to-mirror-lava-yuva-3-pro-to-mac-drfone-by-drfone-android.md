## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Phone to  Lava TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Lava Yuva 3 Pro  devices that allows you to **screen share on Lava Yuva 3 Pro ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  device to your  Lava TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Lava Yuva 3 Pro  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Lava Yuva 3 Pro  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Lava Yuva 3 Pro  users to share their device's screen with  Lava TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Lava TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2011 LED D7000 and above, PDP D8000 and above.
- 2012 LED ES7500 and above, PDP E8000 and above.
- 2013 LED F4500 and above (except F9000 and above), PDP F5500 and above.
- 2014 H4500, H5500 and above (except H6003/H6103/H6153/H6201/H6203).
- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Lava TV. The Samsung devices that support the Smart View feature include Galaxy S Series, Galaxy Z Series, Galaxy Note Series, Galaxy A Series, Galaxy M Series, and Galaxy F Series.

### Steps for Using Smart View to Share Screen

Before explaining the steps, it is important to state that available screens and settings may change depending on your device, Smart TV, or service provider. The Smart View feature is also unavailable on all Samsung devices, and you might need to use the Smart View or Smart Things app.

Ensure that your Samsung device and Smart TV are connected to the same network, and follow these steps for screen sharing:

**Step 1:** After connecting your device and Smart TV to the same Wi-Fi network, open the "Quick Panel" on your Samsung device. Here, press and enable "Smart View."

**Step 2:** Select your  Lava TV among the available devices when Smart View is enabled. Once connected, choose the content you want to share on the TV screen.

## Part 3: How to Share Screen From Samsung Phones to Other Smart TVs?

If your Smart TV is of another brand instead of Samsung, it is still possible to share the Samsung devices screen with your TV. Multiple tools are available online that can be used to share your Samsung device with your TV, depending on the TV brand. You can use tools like AllShare Cast, Chromecast, or Amazon Firestick.

Like Smart View, all wireless screen share tools require your Samsung device and Smart TV to be connected to the same network. Once connected, you will need to plug the respective tool's adapter into your Smart TV, and you should be able to share your Samsung device. If your Smart TV doesn't support Miracast, you can use AllShare Cast Wireless Hub for screen sharing.
