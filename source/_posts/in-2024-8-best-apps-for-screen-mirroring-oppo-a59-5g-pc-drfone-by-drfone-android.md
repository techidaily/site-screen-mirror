### Method 2: Use Screen Mirroring App to Mirror Oppo A59 5G to Roku

Screen Mirroring App for Roku is an easy to use application that allows sharing pictures, videos, and documents from your Android device to Roku TV.

The data is solely captured by the application for mirroring purposes only; no information is stored.
