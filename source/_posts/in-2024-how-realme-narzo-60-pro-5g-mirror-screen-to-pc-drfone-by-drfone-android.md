## Part 4: Screen Mirroring Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to PC Wirelessly – Vysor

Vysor has presented itself as a very strong screen mirroring application for Android phones such as Xiaomi. It provides a USB and ADB connection to its users who wish to mirror Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to PC using Vysor. This application might be referred to as the best in the market; however, it still presents a very peculiar drawback for many of its consumers. Many people have reported a high drainage rate of their phone's battery over using Vysor for screen mirroring through a USB connection. This article looks forward to presenting you with the usage of ADB connection in screen sharing Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G to your PC.

**Step 1: Initiate USB Debugging on your Phone**

If it is not automatically enabled, you need to simply approach the Settings of your phone and open About Phone. You need to open your Developer Options or have them enabled if never done before by tapping on the build number multiple times before enabling the option of USB debugging inside the Developer options.

**Step 2: Open Command Prompt on PC**

Netcfg

Conversely, for phones greater than Android 7, sulk in:

Adb shell

ifconfig

A list shall appear on the Command Prompt, showing a list of all the local IP addresses associated with the computer. You need to locate the IP address of your Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G Android phone and have it copied on the clipboard.

**Step 4: Close and Re-Type IP Address**

You need to exit the ADB window to re-type the IP address for connecting your PC with the phone. Type ‘ADB shell’ to exit the window; however, keep the terminal open. Retype the IP address on the screen.

![retype-your-ip-address](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/08/screen-mirroring-xiaomi-to-pc-2.jpg)

**Step 5: Remove USB Cable and Confirm Connection**

To confirm, you can check the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G device connected through Vysor to observe it active on the list.

## Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G for Streaming

AirPlay has changed the way people stream their music and other media content over several devices over a common wireless network. With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well.

### 1) Double Twist

We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.

### 2) iMediaShare Lite

This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.

### 3) Twonky Beam

Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4) AllShare

For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn't come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 5) Android HiFi and AirBubble

There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144791480.jpg)

### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144964488.jpeg)

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

### 9) Using the DS Video
