6\. At this point, the content will be mirrored on your TV screen, and you can enjoy a viewing experience on a larger screen. Simple!

## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone 13 to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone 13 device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone 13 or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!
