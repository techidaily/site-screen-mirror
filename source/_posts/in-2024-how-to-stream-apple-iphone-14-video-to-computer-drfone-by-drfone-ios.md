## How to Stream Apple iPhone 14 Video to Computer?

The world has progressed with the introduction to smartphones, where major features are being infused on a daily basis that are making the technology decrease in size and increase in the application. Watching movies, reading documents, and working across platforms is now progressing towards smartphones. Many people have started consuming the technology for these purposes with the aim of better control over your posture and your experience. However, there are several drawbacks that are not yet catered with such practical implementations. Thus, people still prefer streaming their videos and sharing their documents across the computer for a better viewing experience. This article provides you a guide on how to stream Apple iPhone 14 video to a computer.


## Part 1: Play Apple iPhone 14 video on computer using built-in AirPlay option

As we look into different scenarios that offer you a platform for streaming your Apple iPhone 14 across a computer, it is significant to initiate the discussion with the built-in AirPlay feature that allows you to stream and play a video from an Apple iPhone 14 onto a computer. As you all are aware of the fact that Apple iPhone 14 has its own operating system that is not compatible directly with any other operating system in the market, it gets necessary to utilize a third-party platform for effectively consuming AirPlay over the PC. As AirPlay works only with other AirPlay-compatible devices, the only solution that would allow you to operate your audio and video over the PC would be by turning it into an AirPlay device with the aid of a certain platform. Before moving towards its installation, it is convenient for you to judge the market compatibility and figure out the most appropriate platform that would allow an effective execution of the screen streaming. With an appropriate platform installed on the PC, you need to simply initiate the AirPlay feature on your Apple iPhone 14 to scan a device that is compatible with an AirPlay device. If your computer still fails to offer such services, it is convenient to look over the firewall settings to amend important settings for enabling the conditions and helping establish the connection.

## Part 2: Stream Apple iPhone 14 video to PC with VLC Streamer

There are a variety of features that offer you the ability to stream your Apple iPhone 14 videos to a PC; however, there are other platforms that allow you to cover it the other way around. VLC Streamer is a perfect platform that offers you to stream videos over an Apple iPhone 14 through a PC. The process for executing this feature is quite simple and straightforward. To understand this process, you need to look over the following guide that explains the appropriate guidelines for streaming your favorite movies from the PC to the iPhone.

**Step 1:** You need to download the VLC streamer across your Apple iPhone 14 and PC simultaneously. Search through the App Store and download its free version across your Apple iPhone 14. Similarly, browse the platform on your PC and download the appropriate version that suits your PC. After downloading, you need to follow the on-screen guidelines to install it across your computer efficiently.

**Step 2:** File up the movies present in your devices, mobiles, or computer on the platform. This can be executed by double-clicking on the icon present on the desktop and launching the platform on your PC.

**Step 3:** Click “Add Movies” to open up the dialog box that would help you browse the movies present on your computer. Select and add the movies onto the VLC Streamer. The movies take a while to process into the platform and would show with a prompt message of “Complete” once they are successfully added.

## Part 1: Is there any free solution to mirror the Apple iPhone 14 screen to PC?

We might be aware of many paid solutions that are available both on the Internet and the App Store aiding users into mirroring their Apple iPhone 14 screen to PC. Conversely, there is a sea of different options that are available for free when discovering the best application to serve for screen sharing Apple iPhone 14 to PC. If you look for the perfect solution that helps you mirror iPad's screen to the computer for free, iTools is one impressive software developed by ThinkSky that provides its consumers with a wired screen mirroring opportunity by connecting the Apple Device with the help of the simple cable.

The wireless mirroring solutions that we have encountered through lack of the quality that iTools possesses with its wired explication. With the requirement of iTools to be tethered with the computer, it cast outs all the discrepancies leading due to incompatibility through Wi-Fi. Along with providing impressive Apple iPhone 14 mirroring to PC features, iTools comes up with its screenshot and recording capabilities. The screen that is being shared on the PC can be recorded or captured in the way it is being displayed for keeping a record of the mirroring. Along with that, iTools allows us to connect with the microphone, leading to a voiceover feature that is covered primarily with the external microphones instead of the built-in audio systems.
