### Method 2: Use Screen Mirroring App to Mirror Nokia 130 Music to Roku

Screen Mirroring App for Roku is an easy to use application that allows sharing pictures, videos, and documents from your Android device to Roku TV. You are not required to amend any phone or wifi setting on your device. All you need to make sure is that both the Roku and your Android device is connected to the same wifi network. The data is solely captured by the application for mirroring purposes only; no information is stored.

**Step 1: Download the Screen Mirroring Application:**

- Unlock your Android device and enter the Google Play Store.
- Download the "Screen Mirroring Application" using this link: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.twokit.screen.mirroring.app.roku)
