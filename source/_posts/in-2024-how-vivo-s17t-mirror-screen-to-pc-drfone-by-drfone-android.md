## How To Do Vivo S17t  Screen Sharing

[![](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/james-davis.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/james-davis/)

Smartphones by Vivo S17t  are rich in functionality and offer multiple benefits to users. However, do we ever wonder about using **screen share in Vivo S17t ?**

Whether there is a need to show unique clicks or videos on a bigger screen or want to stream amazing content on big TVs or computers, we must know **how to screen share on a Vivo S17t  phone.** It becomes a lot easier to cater to a big audience with big screens.

So today, let us go through a detailed guide on **how to screen share in Vivo S17t ** to smart TVs and computers.

![samsung devices featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/12/how-to-share-screen-on-samsung-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Does Screen Sharing Use Bluetooth?

Bluetooth is not used for screen sharing as it does not have the bandwidth required to stream heavy media. Although it is commonly used for wireless data transfer, it is not suited for screen sharing. A major reason behind this is the slowness of Bluetooth, as its maximum speed for data sharing is up to 50MB/s. That makes it unreliable for screen sharing, making Wi-Fi the default choice.

## Part 2: How to Share Screen From Vivo S17t  Phone to  Vivo TV Using Smart View?

Samsung Smart View is a feature in Vivo S17t  devices that allows you to **screen share on Vivo S17t ** Smart TV. First introduced as an app, it is now an in-built feature of One UI.

When using the Smart View feature, you can share videos, photos, documents, games, and other things on your Vivo S17t  device to your  Vivo TV. The Smart View app allows you to use your Vivo S17t  device as a virtual remote to control your Smart TV.

### Requirements for Smart View App

The Vivo S17t  Smart View app was introduced in 2011 to allow Vivo S17t  users to share their device's screen with  Vivo TVs. Although it was discontinued on 05 October 2020 and replaced with Smart Things, its existing user base was not disturbed.

If they were already using the Smart View app or downloaded it before discontinuation, they can use it as long as they don't uninstall it. These are the minimum requirements to use Smart View App on a device:

**Android:** It can be used on Android devices with Android OS 4.1 or above.

**Samsung Smart TVs**

All the Samsung Smart TVs after 2015 are compatible with Samsung Smart View. Below is the list of older  Vivo TV models that offer Smart View compatibility for Samsung users:

- 2011 LED D7000 and above, PDP D8000 and above.
- 2012 LED ES7500 and above, PDP E8000 and above.
- 2013 LED F4500 and above (except F9000 and above), PDP F5500 and above.
- 2014 H4500, H5500 and above (except H6003/H6103/H6153/H6201/H6203).
- 2015 J4500, J5500 and above (except J6203).
- 2016 K4300, K5300 and above.

### Samsung Devices with Smart View Feature

With the introduction of One UI in Samsung devices, the Smart View was added as an in-built feature. All Samsung devices launched with One UI can use the Smart View feature to share their device's screen with  Vivo TV.
