**Review**: "Works pretty well most of the time. Sometimes the picture freezes up, but that may be due to my mobile provider messing with my settings. I close out of Castto and reset my phone network settings, and that usually fixes the problem. This is the only screen mirror app I use, as it is the best performer for me."
