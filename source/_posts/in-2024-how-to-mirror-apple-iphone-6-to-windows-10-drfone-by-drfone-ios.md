### MomoCast

If you look for mirroring your Apple iPhone 6's or iPad's screen while operating a video from a webpage, MomoCast can prove to be very influential and supportive in casting the Apple iPhone 6 to Chromecast. You can play videos on the webpage of the TV using MomoCast or mirror the webpage opened from Apple iPhone 6 to the TV with the help of Chromecast. However, it is to be kept in mind that MomoCast operates with its extension within the Safari webpage, which can then be used for sending information to the TV with the help of streaming devices. The only device that is compatible with MomoCast is Chromecast, for now. It is available on the Internet for free. Though this application might seem quite straightforward in use, it provides impeccable services and results to the users, which is highly preferred.

**Pros:**

- It is a perfect platform that connects with Chromecast without a slight issue.
- It provides an effective remedy from avoiding using different browsers that might affect the quality.

**Cons:**

- There are not a lot of features as in different screen mirroring applications.

If you look forward to using MomoCast as a featured application for screencasting Apple iPhone 6 to Chromecast, you need to follow the step-by-step guide as provided below.

**Step 1:** Install the application on the iPhone and check whether the Apple iPhone 6 devices are connected over the same Wi-Fi.

**Step 2:** Open up the Safari browser, tap on the "Share" button, and select the option of "Cast with MomoCast."

### Reflector

Reflector is another cross-platform screen mirroring software that provides a very impressive feature set for its users. While providing screen mirroring features, it is a commemoration of screen recording, voiceover addition, and live streaming.

This platform is available from pricing plans starting from $6.99 and is compatible with both Windows and macOS.

**Pros:**

- Reflector offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Variety of features are offered apart from screen mirroring.
- There is a variety in selecting the Apple iPhone 6 device frames.

**Cons:**

**Step 1:** For casting Apple iPhone 6 to Chromecast, you would need a combination of Reflector 3 and AirParrot 2 that is to be launched on the PC.

**Step 2:** Following this, you need to initially mirror your Apple iPhone 6 on the PC with Reflector.
