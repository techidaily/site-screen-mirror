| The mobile devices that will continue to come in the future years will be without a USB port, which means that these methods will get outdated. | As you do not require any USB port connection, you do not have to worry about getting the software supporting wireless connections. |
| On connecting an Android with a Mac through a USB, the Itel A60s device starts charging, which takes up more battery of the Mac. | With no direct wired connections, you can save your Mac's battery, giving you more screen time. |
| You are bound to keep your Android with the Mac, as the connections are attached through wires. | Using such techniques allows you to take the Itel A60s device anywhere within the room while it is mirrored with the Mac. |
| Android devices cannot directly connect with the Mac as the latest models do not have USB ports. You will have to buy special extenders, which are pretty costly. | You require a strong Wi-Fi connection to connect the Itel A60s devices, saving you extra costs. |

## Top 10 AirPlay Apps in Itel A60s for Streaming

AirPlay has changed the way people stream their music and other media content over several devices over a common wireless network. With multiple applications available for the users of Android, the feature has been successful in reaching out to other users as well. Today, we take a look at the best Android AirPlay apps that are available in the App Store. While the applications vary in their interface and technicalities, there is no denying that each of these apps performs the functions well. While earlier Apple was quick to ban anything that supported AirPlay other than iOS devices, good times are certainly upon the users who wished for some third-party platforms to use AirPlay through their Android devices. You can also read more about smart technology with a mobile app to make your life easier.

Here is our list of the top 10 AirPlay apps for Android.

### 1) Double Twist

We have mentioned this app quite a number of times on our platform. A free app that helps to sync your Android device with iTunes and other services as a media player, it has new AirPlay support that is available for users who upgrade with AirSync. AirSync is an app that is available for download after a payment of $5 that allows the Double Twist app to sync with iTunes but requires a free desktop assistant. Using the same wireless network, you can stream media content from your Android device.

Download it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doubleTwist.androidPlayer&hl=en)

### 2) iMediaShare Lite

This is another free application that is useful for streaming music, photos, videos, and other media content from your Android device to your Apple TV, but only if they are connected over the same wireless network. Only requiring the installation of this application, it will detect your Apple TV from the android device itself. The ones who love to stream from online sites like YouTube, CNN, etc. would particularly enjoy this application.

![top AirPlay apps in Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/14542144193129.jpg)

### 3) Twonky Beam

Moving on in our list with Twonky Beam, which happens to be a free application for AirPlay, and offers users the freedom to stream audio, video, and photos to Apple TV and any other device of their choice. For the ones who prefer the internet to stream their multimedia content, this app offers an enjoyable experience. The working of this application resembles that of AirPlay mirroring. The media stored on your computer can also be accessed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4) AllShare

For the ones who have regularly used Samsung devices, the mention of this app doesn't come as a surprise as this app comes preloaded within the Itel A60s device and is very similar to the working of AirPlay. With this application, users can access all the data that is stored on other devices and hence, play it on their android device. However, the major functionality that is offered is that of being able to stream media content on your Apple TV.

### 5) Android HiFi and AirBubble

There are two ways of looking at this application; Android HiFi is the free version while the AirBubble license app costs a mere $2 bucks. Through the application, one can convert their android device into an AirPlay receiver. Audio content can be played on the Android device from iTunes or other iOS Devices. This is particularly useful for the ones who wish to roam around the house with a common wireless network in place.

### 6) Zappo TV

One of the many online multimedia services, this one has android apps for AirPlay for Apple TV, WD TV Live, Samsung, Sony, and LG TVs, but we won't recommend that you bank upon their popularity. However, the user experience may vary from device to device.

### 7) AirPlay and DLNA Player

This one is a free application and does all it should justify its name. It is basically a DLNA and UPnP player along with offering support for your Apple TV. After the installation of the application is complete, users have the option to stream media content from their android or iOS device to the Apple TV. This app is a popular medium to connect your Android Device to your Apple TV.

### 8) Using Allcast

For the users who are well acquainted with Double Twist, this app comes as a pleasant upgrade. The app performs the same function but does it better than its prequel. Offering you a list of devices to stream your content, all you have to do is choose the big screen and you are good to go. However, unlike Double Twist, this one doesn't allow you to access applications in the background while you sit back and enjoy your music. Also, nothing much to enjoy on the screen while the music is being played.

Also, along with each movie, one can find enough information to reach a conclusive decision. The users also have the option to record TV programs and manage their viewing schedule.

With the option to send any media content to the Apple-TV, this is a great way to enjoy all your media content on the Apple TV without having to worry about any iOS devices.
