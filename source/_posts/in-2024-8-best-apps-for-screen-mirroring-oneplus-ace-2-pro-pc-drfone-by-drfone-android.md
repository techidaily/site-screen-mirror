The experience is unlimited and includes sharing and playing your Android smartphone content to your tablet and even exporting content from your smartphone to your tablet. Android to Android mirroring is amazing, and you just might want to try it out. It uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even mobile hotspots.

This enables, among other things, a better viewing experience, and one can access the internet on another android device through a cellular network of another device. ScreenShare is a free application, and its features are limited to work with Android phone sharing with Android tablets.
