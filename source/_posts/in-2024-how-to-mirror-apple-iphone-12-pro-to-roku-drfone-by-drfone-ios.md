## Part 2: How to Mirror Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Roku with Video & TV Cast for Roku?

Now that you have set up Roku’s mirroring functions, you are ready to put it into action. One of the main reasons that Roku is so popular is its wide range of compatibility with different Apple devices – you can use this app with any version of an Apple iPhone 12 Pro or iPad.

1\. Ensure that you have correctly installed the Roku app on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro or iPad. You can get it from [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/roku/id482066631?mt=8).

2\. Once the installation process is complete, launch the app on your device.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242176713.jpg)

4\. From the toolbar at the bottom, select the “Play On Roku” option.

![enable mirror function on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/10/14758242341845.jpg)

## Part 3: How to solve issues when mirroring your Apple iPhone 12 Pro to Roku?

Now that you have Roku installed on your device and you have selected some content to watch on a larger screen, it is time to kick back and enjoy. That said, what happens if you think that you have done everything correctly and it still doesn’t work? We have some solutions below.

The first point? Be patient! Once you hit play on the video, it might take a few seconds or longer for the content to start playing. Roku is a newly developed technology and it is getting quicker all the time.

That said, if it takes more than a minute or so and Roku is still not working, here are some solutions that you can try.

1\. You may encounter a time lag between the audio and visuals while you watch a video mirrored on the TV.

It can be really annoying to try to watch a video when the sound is not properly synced up. If there is a lag between the audio and video on your TV, it may be the result of Roku’s rapidly developing technology. As this is still a new app, sometimes a lag occurs. The best way to try to fix this issue is to restart the video. Once you restart, usually the sound issue will adjust itself.

2\. While Roku mirrors an iPad, the video suddenly stops

Some people who have used Roku to mirror their iPad onto their TVs have reported that the video can sometimes just stop. The most common solution is to ensure that your iPad (or iPhone) is turned on, and that the screen’s display has not gone to sleep. If your display is turned off, the mirroring function stops automatically. To avoid this problem, just set the display time on your device’s display long enough to satisfy your needs.

3\. The mirroring does not start while using a Roku iPad mirror.

Again, it is a very common issue. As we have mentioned earlier, Roku is a new form of technology, and it does not always work perfectly. Turn the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device off, wait for a few minutes and try again.

Roku is fast becoming an essential app, and mirroring is just one of the many features that it offers. Even though it cannot match the premium quality Apple TV quite yet, it is still one of the best choices available in the market for Apple users who want to mirror their Apple iPhone 12 Pro or iPad onto their TV. Go for it!

## Best Apple iPhone 12 Pro & iPad Screen Mirroring App

## Part 1. Benefits of Using a Screen Mirroring App for iPhone and iPad

Yes, screen mirroring is helpful in many ways, which prompts users to opt for solutions that allow the process. But what are the benefits you can expect from downloading and using this software on iPad or iPhone devices? Let's get to know some of the best ones.

- **Streaming videos/movies-** Many users prefer using different streaming services on smartphones and tablets. But the screen size and resolution can be smaller in these devices, decreasing user experience. With the **best free screen mirroring app for iPhone,** you can reflect the content from smaller devices to more giant monitors.
- **Game mirroring-** Some of the best games are available only as mobile apps, and many users want to view the gameplay on more giant screens. A screen mirroring tool is helpful here.
- **Business presentation-** In business meetings or conferences, a professional may have to show the entire presentation of a project plan, some documentation, or a software tutorial to all participants. For this, projecting the video on a bigger screen quickly through an app is valuable.
- **No support for AirPlay-** The preset screen mirroring feature on iPhones and iPads is AirPlay. It is helpful for high-quality projection across devices. However, it is incompatible with various apps, like video streaming platforms. So, users have to use an alternative app for the task, which we shall discuss here, starting with Dr.Fone Air.
